Tabula Rasa treats all of stealth, mind-reading, lies, plots, locks, lying, etc. as essentially the same thing: secrets. A secret is a piece of information at least one [[section-mush/Character|character]] is trying to keep hidden from other characters.

## Deception
Whenever a character wants to hide something they need to make a [[Checks|check]] to do so successfully. Whenever a character does something that could reveal the existence of one of their secrets they need to make a check to keep it hidden. If a character fails one of these checks other characters may learn their secret or become suspicious it exists.

## Suspicious
When a character is suspicious they know of the exististence of the secret but don't know what it is. A suspicious character can make [[Checks|checks]] to attempt to discover the secret.

## Oblivious
A character is oblivious when they neither know the secret not know of it's existence. If a [[Conflict|conflict]] begins any oblivious characters will be [[Surprised|surprised]]. Most characters are oblivious of most secrets.

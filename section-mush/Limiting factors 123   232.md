### limiting factors
at one point i recommended having the DM nerf skills while they were being made. give them a mana cost, or a cooldown, or make them take a long time or whatever to help balance them. this is a good time to say that skills should have a type of action associated with them (major, minor, reaction, etc.) and this should be determined at skill creation.
most of the time limiting factors will need to come out for "magic" skills. a cooldown (recharges on 5 or 6 of 1d6 OR one use per day OR mana), a range restriction (you have to touch them OR be able to see them OR something), or a speed restriction (ritual magic that takes anywhere from a few minutes to a few days and cannot be done in combat).

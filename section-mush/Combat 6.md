## Combat

This really isn't a section describing combat, but instead a section describing any extended competitive activity within a story where timing is incredibly important. Sword and gun fights certainly fit the mould, sure, but so do a number of other things like horse races, ritual summoning gone wrong, and trying to command a fleet with light-minutes of delay. Combat in this game is based on actions and cooldowns. Despite this these rules will focus on the more traditional combat and I will leave you, dear reader, to adapt them to your competitive pie-eating contests as necessary.

### Intent

It isn't intended to be fair, realistic, or deep. It is intended to be dramatic (and fun). Like the rest of the system players can have their characters do anything they think of. This means players can say "I would like to shoot that robot in the power core" with the reasonable expectation that the robot will be incapacitated if they they pass their shooting check. There are two problems with this. First, suddenly gaining the death flavor is well and good for henchmen but big-bad-evil-guys need time to monologue and should always be dealt the dying flavor instead. Second, again instant death is fine for henchmen but bosses and players should be harder to kill.

The intent is to make it hard to kill named characters before their defences have been lowered. Once the boss robot's force field has been shorted out with a bucket of water then can be dealt some form of the dying flavor at normal difficulty and finished off as an action or once combat ends.

#### Major Actions

Major actions are used to do pretty much everything in combat other than move or take out-of-turn actions. Most of the time you will need to use a major action to attack, interact with the environment, cast spells, create advantages or disadvantages, etc.

##### Attacking

Attacking costs an action. All attacks are called shots. Describe the attack to the storyteller and they will assign a difficulty. The storyteller does not have to reveal all of an NPCs defences or their effect on the difficulty of attacks made against that NPC but in general they should because it saves time. If a player makes a check for an an attack action and passes it the called shot just happens as usual unless the defender has relevant defences the attacker didn't know about. The idea here is that weak enemies can be defeated outright and you will need to chip down the defences of more difficult enemies before you can defeat them. Attacks that result in wounds that will take a long time to heal or will never heal should be marked on the relevant character sheet as flavor. The difficulty of an attack is based on any relevant flavor like armor and weapons, the context of the attack, and how difficult the called shot is. Consider the attacker's weapon and the defender's armor. Consider context like visibility, elevation, flanking, wounds, etc. Consider how these things influence the difficulty of that specific called shot. Consider the players opinions on what the difficulty should be. To disable and capture an enemy make the appropriate called shot. Weapons do damage in a way that makes sense. Swords do sword-damage, guns do gun-damage and fireballs do fireball-damage. Respective this would be things like cuts/stabs, bullet wounds, and being blown up/set on fire. If wounds (bad flavor from combat) would make a character's ability to move non-trivial, that character is downed. If a character's ability to perform actions ever becomes impossible that character is either unconscious or incapacitated and possibly dead. If a character is ever incapacitated, downed, or unconscious they are likely at risk of being killed by a coup de gras. For all of these things make "does this make sense" checks. If a player has an attack that is an AOE consider adding a limiting factor to it. The default difficulty for a fair fight is "normal" which is to say not trivial, easy, hard, or impossible.

##### advantages and disadvantages

As an action character may attempt to create an advantage for themselves or a disadvantage for another character. If the action succeeds whomever is controlling the character gets to describe the advantage they create. If the storyteller finds it reasonable it happens. If not, don’t waste time arguing, just move on.

An advantage can also take the form of having to roll fewer dice on a skill check in the future, or a bonus to initiative. Inversely an advantage might mean that the character’s opponents have to roll more dice on skill checks, get fewer dice on their damage rolls, or lose initiative.

##### Interactions

Players can decide to make non-combative actions during a combat like reading a scroll to help decipher a puzzle or pulling a lever to open a door. These things are typically major actions as they are distracting and take time. Many other things are major actions. Note to self: add some more examples.

#### Move Actions

Move actions are the simplest of the actions. If you need to change zones in battle you will need to make a move action. That said small bits of movement in the same zone like footwork in combat or walking two meters to a different computer terminal would not be considered large enough movement to require a move action. See the Distance section for a more complete look at the movement system. Sometimes when using a reaction to dodge the dodge won't make sense unless it also moves you. In this case you will also need a move action in order to dodge.

##### Dodging

Some defensive actions require a character to get out of the way to avoid an attack. In these cases character will need to spend a movement action in addition to a reaction to make a defensive action.

#### Reactions

Reactions are actions that characters can use to act out of turn. This is most commonly used for defensive actions. Anytime a character uses their reaction they can make a free defensive action. Acting out of turn to counterattack, defend yourself or another character, or by holding a major action all require a character's reaction. On the subject of ordering, all actions must be able to be reacted to. In addition all reactions occur after the action that caused them.

##### Counterattacks

If you want to stab a bitch that tried to stab you, you must consume your major action and your reaction.

##### Defensive Actions

Defensive actions are those that characters do to avoid the bad flavor that comes with an attack. Commonly this means blocking, dodging, parrying, etc. Uncommonly this means counterattacking to remove a threat before it can hurt you, or jumping in front of an attack for another character.

#### Free Actions

Free actions do not require an action and can be performed at any time during combat assuming you pass a DTMS check. Actions that would be trivial out of combat are typically free actions in combat. This would include talking, inventory management (dropping items or giving them to another character), and most perception checks--sometimes even those that are non-trivial.

### Transitions

Feel tree to maintain or drop initiative as you switch between chases, combats, and stealth scenes. Use logic to determine when it appropriate to switch between these and when to roll and drop initiative. Characters that start a combat or chase should go first. Characters need to be hidden if they want to start a stealth scene. Any of these can transition into any of the others. Chases are just combat with movement instead of fighting. Initiative for chases and combats works the same.

### Entering and Leaving combat

Entering combat is simple. When a player decides they would like to enter combat they do so in 1d6+AD AUTs. The same goes for the storyteller's NPCs. Characters must pass a DTMS check to join combat ie. they must be present.

### War

Once the number of NCPs gets into the double digits it doesn't make a whole lot of sense to actually play the individual characters in combat. In this case the NPC battle is narrated with the PC party being able to influence the outcome through their success or failure in smaller battles where most of the combatants matter. When the storyteller ends up controlling more than triple the number of units the PCs do that is probably a good time to change things to a simultaneous battle and war.

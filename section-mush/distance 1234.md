distance is an important part of combat. In the interest of avoiding specifics I think I will describe distances as AUDs or Arbitrary Units of Distance. These are equivalent to one square of graph paper or one square on a battle grid.
Rather than using a battle-grid you might also use a sketch of the map with a very loose grid of "zones" over the top. Zones take one movement action to move between. This works best when zones are easy to define like rooms in buildings.

## storytelling
this should probably be divided int a few separate sections. creating settings, story arcs, the DM screen, etc. are all fairly different topics.
***
maybe a section for common problems and solutions with this system.
DON'T make a section for how to roleplay NPCs.
maybe make a section for creating NPC's? it is worth addressing why there isn't a monster manual at least.
this section is devoted to running a game of this system and providing a DM useful tools for that. a FAQ section might also be a good idea.
tips for running (group) combat quickly.

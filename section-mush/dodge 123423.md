### Dodge
Dodge should be the opposition to to-hit rolls. think about armor coverage vs armor hardness. i also have the idea that the only way to avoid damage that has independently passed the to-hit stage is to use a reaction to dodge.
I like the notion that dodging should require a reaction. At storyteller discretion dodging some things might take a reaction and then some. I would say that to "dodge" an explosion you need to get out of it and that would require a move action as well.

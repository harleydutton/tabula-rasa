## Combat
It looks like i was favoring shadowrun style initiative/speed in the past
disallowing called shots in favor of the doubles -> dragon dice method from dragon age seems really good. shadowrun style initiative is where characters roll initiative and get a score, and then combat goes in rounds. Each round subtracts some number (10 in shadowrun) from each intiative and each character that still has a non-negative initiative score gets a turn.

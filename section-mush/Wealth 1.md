In Tabula, money is very abstract to avoid tedium and allow each setting to have its own currency. Wealth is [[section-mush/Character]] stat representing the total material posessions and liquid currency a character *should* posess.

[[problems]] what if there isn't a currenncy? barter obviously becomes a thing but the *should* part of wealth breaks down. I'm going to say the character acquires flavor the storyteller deems reasonable based on their character's gethering skills or something like that. Maybe they deal in favors, idk.

## Get Rich Quick
Wealth scaling is a [[problems]] previously it was 1cp -> 1 wealth though I think I might want change that to geometric or exponential scaling.

## Currency
Currency is a generic name for whatever the money in the [[Setting]] is called. That said, it will  always spend the same and one unit of currency can pay for one "cheap" item.

[[problems]] where should I talk about boons?

## Items
Items are a character's material posessions. Items are represented on a character sheet as a list of short, descriptive names with quantity where appliccable.

[[problems]] where do I talk about the store?

### Expenses
Expenses are recurring costs a character is paying that limit their available wealth. Though they are intangible, they can be thought of as items.

## Refreshing
On regular intervals, usually during [[Downtime]], the sum of a character's liquid currency and items should change to match their wealth stat. Usually this will cause characters to receive currency for their used, broken, and lost equipment such that they can make new purchases. This can however cause characters to lose currency or even items if they don't have a high enough wealth score.

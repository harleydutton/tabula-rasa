Characters usually get stronger over the course of a story. They can acquire new skills, level up the existing ones, and get new flavor including but not limited to items, social status, and followers.

### **Character Point Acquisition**

Character points are given by the storyteller at character creation and usually also session by session. Character points are typically awarded for heroics, good roleplaying, and completing quests. The storyteller should keep a running total on the setting document of how many CP have been given out to the group.

### **Flavor Acquisition**

Your character will acquire flavor throughout the story for mostly for free. You can, however, pay for it in the same way as you would during character creation. Hooks and boons can be acquired through roleplaying, items and other things worth one CP can be obtained from stores where available, and temporary wound flavor is the natural result of combat. Beware, actions have consequences and sometimes flavor will be inflicted upon you.

#### **Crafting**

In Tabula, crafting an item is just a skill check. Describe what you want and how you plan on using your crafting skill to get it, ask the storyteller what the difficulty is, and make the roll. If you succeed you get the desired item, likely with some narrative flair. If you fail you do not get what you asked for, any materials and time put into the crafting roll are lost, and it is possible something bad happens.

### **Skill Acquisition**

Skills can be learned from other characters in the story. If a skill is fairly simple or if a character is fairly dedicated they can learn it on their own. Dedicated characters can also create new skills and add them to the setting--once again, only with storyteller approval. The first level of any new skill costs one character point. All skill acquisitions need to pass a DTMS check.

### **Skill Progression**

Leveling up skills can happen at any time and requires CP. The CP cost varies by level and type of skill. Mandatory skills are significantly more expensive than available skills to level up.

#### **Mandatory Skills Progression**

Mandatory skills are Body, Mind, Spirit and Social. The cost to level a mandatory skill is the desired level squared in CP. You must level up skills one level at a time.

|   |   |   |   |   |   |   |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
      
|**Level**|**1**|**2**|**3**|**4**|**5**|**X**|
|CP Cost|0 CP|4 CP|9 CP|16 CP|25 CP|X*X CP|
|Total CP|0 CP|4 CP|13 CP|29 CP|54 CP|...|

#### **Attribute Progression**

The attributes are Body, Mind, Spirit and Social. The cost to level an attribute is the desired level squared in CP. If you wish to raise an attribute more than one level at a time you must still pay for the intermediate levels.

|   |   |   |   |   |   |   |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
|**Level**|**1**|**2**|**3**|**4**|**5**|**X+1**|
|CP Cost|1 CP|2 CP|3 CP|4 CP|5 CP|X CP|
|Total CP|1 CP|3 CP|6 CP|10 CP|15 CP|...|

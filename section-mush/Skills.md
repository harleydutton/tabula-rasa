Skills represent the things a [[section-mush/Character|character]] is good at doing. A skill consists of a name and level. The level determines how many dice the character gets to roll when making a [[section-mush/Checks|check]] using the skill.

## Creating a Skill
Consult the [[Limits|limits]] section of the [[section-mush/Setting|setting]] and think up a skill within those bounds and run the idea by your [[section-mush/Storyteller|storyteller]]. If they approve it it will be added to the setting (possibly with new limits) after which characters can take and level the skill like any other.

## Taking Skills
[[Content]]/[[Limits]]([[problems]]) will have a list of skills characters can take that are appropriate to the setting. To take a skill simply add it to your character sheet in the skills section and pay CP to level it up to at least level 1. As defined in the [[Limits]] section you may also have to pay [[Hooks]]/[[Boons]] ([[problems]]).

## Leveling Skills
Leveling skills can be done any time the character has [[Character Points|character points]][[problems|]] to spend. The cost of leveling up a skill follows a geometric sequence such that the first level costs 1 CP, the second level costs 2CP, the third costs 3CP and so on making the cumulative cost of level 3 a total of 6 CP.
[[design decisions]] should I include the leveling table here? X(X+1)/2 CP

[[balance decisions]] the cost to level skills follows a gemometric sequence. (the CP cost to level is always the same as the resulting level) If leveling up a skill multiple times the level up cost for each intermediary level must be paid.

[[design decisions]] Should I include skill examples? pickpocket, pyromancy, intimidation, stealth, clairvoyance, and blocking are all examples of skills. [[formatting decisions]] if so, how should I format them?

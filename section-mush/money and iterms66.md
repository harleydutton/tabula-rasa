## Money and Items

In Tabula, money is very abstract to avoid tedium and allow each setting to have its own currency. Items will be listed in the setting store with a price of free, cheap, expensive or unavailable though this store cannot be comprehensive. Money can be gotten by converting character points (CP) or boons into purchasing power, then, when it is spent it will refresh at the beginning of downtime. Money and Items are both Flavor.

### Purchasing Power

Purchasing power represents the amount of wealth a character should have. Sometimes they will have more, sometimes less, but they will usually trend back toward their purchasing power. Characters all start with no purchasing power but purchasing power can be acquired at character creation and at the beginning of downtime. One character point can be converted to one minor purchasing power. Alternatively, one boon can be converted into one major purchasing power. This process cannot be undone. Track your major and minor purchasing power on your character sheet. When you acquire purchasing power you also immediately get one unit of the matching type of setting specific currency.

### Currency

Purchasing power will get you setting specific currency when you acquire it and when it refreshes. In the example setting, Sequoia, one unit of minor currency is represented by one finger sized chunk of amber. Similarly, one unit of major currency is represented by one knuckle sized shard of aether. What a unit of major or minor currency represents is arbitrary and will usually differ between settings. This system makes no effort to establish a conversion rate between major and minor currency. Currency can be spent on goods and services.

In Sequoia, the included setting,  there are two popular currencies. Amber is commonly traded in chunks about the size of a finger. Typically amber is used to purchase cheap things like food, lodging, or entertainment. Aether is traded in small shards about the size of a knuckle. One shard of aether commands a high price and can be used to buy expensive things like vehicles, land, medicine, or education. 

### Items

Items are a type of flavor that can be bought, found, looted, lost, made, destroyed, broken, sold, borrowed, lent, etc. A unit of minor currency can be used to buy cheap items. Similarly a unit of major currency can be used to buy expensive items. When tracking items on your character sheet, keep track of their price. To do this, put an F, C, or E next to each item to denote them as free, cheap, or expensive respectively. The setting store should give you an idea what is available within the world and what it will cost. Individual stores within the story almost never match up with what is available in the entire world of the setting.

### Refreshing

Some of you may be concerned that if you convert boons and CP to items and then lose them your character will be weaker forever. Fear not! Purchases refresh at the beginning of downtime. Specifically, at the beginning of downtime if you have fewer combined cheap items and units of minor currency than out have minor purchasing power, you get units of minor currency equal to the difference. The same is true of expensive items, units of major currency and major purchasing power. The idea here is that not all of your time within the story is accounted for and while the camera isn’t on you, you are trending back toward your typical level of wealthare doing something profitable.

### Buying

The typical way characters get items is by buying them. This is done by finding a store that has what you want and trading the relevant purchase for it. The upside of this is that you can get the items you want immediately. The downside is that selection is often limited.

### Commissioning

If the local stores don't have what you want, typically you can pay NPCs to make items for you. This will take some time, probably cost more, and you might not get exactly what you want.

### Crafting

Crafting can be used to make items. The upside to crafting is that it gives players more flexibility than buying. Crafting is useful because you can make custom items, items that are otherwise locally unavailable, items that have never existed, or just whatever you need at the moment. The downsides are that it takes longer and has the potential to fail. To start, purchase or gather materials. Next, as usual, propose an item to your storyteller. If they accept, describe how you make it and make a roll. The difficulty of the crafting check is determined by tools used, time taken, material price, and the value of the item being made. If you succeed, you get the item you were attempting to craft. If you don't, the materials are lost, and if you are out of materials you will have to try again when your currency has refreshed and you can afford new ones.

### Selling

Items can be sold! If you want your purchase back, simply find a character in the story who wants it. If you sell a cheap item, you immediately get a unit of minor currency and can spend it on something else. The same is true of expensive items and units of major currency.

### Lending

If you let another player character borrow one of your items, it still counts as your item and affects your item counts and purchasing power and not theirs. You cannot break this system by giving all of your items to other characters because your purchases won't refresh.

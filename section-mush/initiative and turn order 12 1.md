### initiative and turn order
in the past i have noticed some things. first if initiative doesn't just go around the table (counter)clockwise it takes way longer. second, sometimes you can't just go around the table (like when playing online) so Tabula should still have a way to roll initiative regardless or IRL conditions.
So there are a few ways to do initiative. There is the usual D&D way where everyone rolls, gets a number, and then goes in order. This is a lot of work to maintain. VTM had celerity which gave characters additional turns at then end of the round. This did an excellent job of representing superhuman speed but it was OP as shit and could make players without it feel useless. then there is shadowrun initiative which was a lot of sense. essentially players rolled for initiative like normal but you subtracted initiative to take actions until everyone was out and then started a new round. I think the exalted system is probably the best system for my purposes. It can support characters that are dramatically faster than others and it doesn't require an undue ammount of bookkeeping. basically each character has an action delay and the dm calls our the current world initiative. you get to act (all of your actions refresh) once your cooldown is up. I don't remember how initial initiative order was picked. I suppose I could go take a look at an exalted book or make my own.

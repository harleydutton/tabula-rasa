## **Character Creation**

To make a character first read through the setting document your storyteller has provided you with. When you have done this and understand the world you will be playing in read through this and fill in the sections for the character sheet--located at the end of this section--using what you have learned. Ask your storyteller for help with things you do not understand or consult the table of contents.

### **Identification Information**

These things go on your sheet to keep you and your storyteller sane in real life. You can omit these things if you like but it is not recommended and I already carved out some space on the sheet for it.

- Name: The character's name
    
- Character concept: ?
    
- Player: The player's name
    
- Setting: The name of the character's setting
    
- Story: The name of the story the character was in
    
- CPaquired and spent
    

The storyteller should be tracking the CP they have distributed to the group on the setting document. Each player should be keeping track of how much of this they have not spent on their character sheet such that they can easily take new skills.

### **Motivations**

Tell me why your character gets out of bed in the morning. What is their purpose? Do they seek revenge? To protect something? Are they on the run? Do they want to be respected? Are they searching for something? Do they have any ideals that they follow? These are all motivations that will give a storyteller a good way to interact with your character. You must have at least one and you should consider taking a few.

### **Aesthetic Description**

This is a good place to describe your character's gender, age, weight, build, height, bearing, clothes, stereotypical class, etc. The purpose of this section is to give other players or the storyteller an idea of what your character looks and acts like. If you want anything here to influence your rolls it should also be added to flavor.

### **Flavor** [[flavor comment]]

Flavor is a word or short phrase describing your character. While you could say your character has clothes and the ability to speak, let's not worry about that and instead focus on the things that spice your character up! Flavor can include knowledge, possessions, physique, and even social position. Most flavor costs one CP at character creation or one hook for those which are particularly powerful. More flavor can be obtained or inflicted later on in the game.

### **Hooks**

**Hooks** are a special piece of flavor that the storyteller can use to interact specifically with your character to create tension within the story. Adding a hook to your character is the typical way to go about getting a boon and it also integrates your character into the story a little better most times. A hook can be a love interest, an enemy, a debt, a cause, a disability, and much more. When you would like to add a hook to your character you must first discuss it with your storyteller and if they agree to let you take the hook you also get a boon. Hooks are distinct from motivations in that they don't always come from within e.g. being #17 on the FBI most wanted list.

### **Boons**

**Boons** arethe extra powerful version of flavor. Boons can only be obtained through hooks. Boons allow characters to be abnormally large, a powerful non-human, unusually rich or famous, or have a magic skill, or some smart, loyal minions. Boons can also be exchanged for a renewable [major purchase](#major-purchases).

.**Skills**

Skills are the most mechanical part of a character. They allow your character to make actions by rolling checks. Skills have levels and are usually self-descriptively named though there is space for skill descriptions on the character sheet. You can purchase skills with CP at character creation and level them up later using CP.

pickpocket, pyromancy, intimidation, stealth, clairvoyance, and blocking are all examples of skills.

#### **Attributes**

Attributes Body, Mind, Spirit and Social. They are similar to skills but have meaningful differences. First, every character gets the first level of each attribute for free. Second, attributes cost significantly more CP to level up than skills do. Third, attributes are broad and if a character does not have an applicable skill they can roll an attribute. For this reason attributes are frequently used as defensive skills and for perception checks. Lastly, attributes represent a character's physical, mental, spiritual, and social health. This is discussed in more depth in the Damage section.

|   |   |   |   |   |   |   |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
      
|**Level**|**1**|**2**|**3**|**4**|**5**|**X**|
|CP Cost|0 CP|4 CP|9 CP|16 CP|25 CP|X*X CP|
|Total CP|0 CP|4 CP|13 CP|29 CP|54 CP|(X(X+1)(2X+1)/6)-1 CP|

#### **Skills**

Skills are listed on the setting. This should include all of the skills the players or storyteller have added to the setting. These skills are available within the setting to any character passing a DTMS check and can be purchased as normal.

|   |   |   |   |   |   |   |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
      
|**Level**|**1**|**2**|**3**|**4**|**5**|**X+1**|
|CP Cost|1 CP|2 CP|3 CP|4 CP|5 CP|X CP|
|Total CP|1 CP|3 CP|6 CP|10 CP|15 CP|X(X+1)/2 CP|

**Adding to the Setting**

It is the intent of this system that you can play what you want. Players can speak with the storyteller and propose things to be added to the setting. If you want to play a cat-man samurai talk to the storyteller about adding cat-men to the setting and if samurai need special skills or tools to be relevant, propose those too. If the storyteller agrees, "Boom!", you can play what you want.

#### **Veto**

The storyteller can reject your additions to the setting for any reason. You can bitch and moan but ultimately the storyteller is the one telling the story and doesn't have to put your idea in the story no matter how much you want it there. Come up with a new idea.

@Storyteller: In the interest of reducing arguing, bitching, and moaning, give a reason for your veto.

#### **Theme**

A common reason for an addition to a setting to be rejected is because of theme. Don't try to play a wizard in a non-magic setting. Don't try to play a jedi in a medieval setting. Sure there are storytellers who will jump at that but try to stay within the themes outlined in the setting document.

#### **Scope**

Many times, players will try to create skills that are much too broad in scope. Less frequently, players will make skills that are too narrow in scope. Loosely speaking scope represents the percentage of situations a skill can apply to. An example of a skill that is too broad is magic as you can do anything you want with it. A skill that is too narrow would be death curse as it can only be used to kill someone. Somewhere in between we find the skill death magic which has many applications but not infinitely many. It has a specific domain in which it is useful. Storytellers should specifically look out for skills that are too broad during character creation and veto them.

#### **Limiting Factors**

If you create a skill with appropriate scope that is just too powerful for the setting or story your storyteller may inflict a few limiting factors upon the skill you have proposed or your character.

@Storyteller: A few good limiting factors are timing restrictions(requires multiple turns in combat, cannot be done in combat, takes multiple days, etc.), resource costs (add a mana bar, minor purchases, major purchases, etc.), context restrictions (must have line of sight, must have eye contact, must be touching the target, must have a piece of the target, etc.), and cooldowns (AUTs or turns, once per combat, once per day, refreshes randomly, etc.).

#### **Uniqueness**

When you add something to the setting you may have it in your head that it will be unique. You will be the only fire mage, you will have the only gun, you will be the only alien, etc. This can very quickly lead to an unbalanced and unenjoyable setting or story. Do not expect to have a monopoly on anything you add to the setting. Where there is one, there can be two.

### **Speed**

This is how long your character has to wait to do things in combat. Lower means faster. If you would like to decrease your action delay you can do so by spending CP. The default action delay is 10 but you should take a look at the setting document provided by your storyteller to make sure.

|Total cost|0|1 CP|5 CP|14 CP|30 CP|55 CP|...|

  
  

**NPCs**

. If you go through the character creation process for an NPC, you should end up with a character of similar power level to the PCs, assuming you use the same amount of cp. If they need to be combat capable make sure they have an AD. If they are there to talk make sure they have *at least* one motivation. Leaving a large chunk of an NPCs CP unspent is a good way to keep them flexible.

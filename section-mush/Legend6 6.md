This is a list of formatting choices I have made throughout this document to better inform you, dear reader:

-   section specific keywords will be in bold
-   things–like interjections–will be hyphenated
-   The first example of each abbreviation (ABRV) in a section will be in parenthesis
-   placing emphasis on words will be done with italics
-   sections will be referenced using links
-   examples of specific skills and flavor will be monospace in-line
-   larger examples will be block-quoted and appear under the relevant section with no header

### creating NPCs
same as PCs but don't spend ALL of their exp immediately. allow them to fudge the numbers and gain skills as needed. maybe create their special skill if they have one immediately.
leveling up NPCs using the elder scrolls style tally marks might be a miserable pain. propose an alternative.

previously i advocated for magnitude of success. this was likely due to "the crafting problem". if you don't have magnitude of success for crafting then any sword a blacksmith makes is as good as any other sword in the universe. magnitude of success solved this problem by generating a number you could tack onto the created equipment.
I have though of an alternative to this (crappy) solution to "the crafting problem". Instead of determining the quality of the sword after it is done decide on the quality before the roll is made, apply an equivalently sized bonus or penalty and then make the roll. after that it is simple success/failure. the dm can determine if what is created is anything other than garbage upon failure.
It is worth noting that the crafting problem goes away when you remove the numeric values from combat.

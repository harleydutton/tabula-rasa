In Tabula money has been abstracted away as annoying bookkeeping. Many common items will be effectively free. When you actually have money it will usually be the flavor minor purchase or less commonly a major purchase. These purchases can be roleplayed as being whatever the native currency of the world is be it gold coins, bank notes, or space-bucks. To understand how these purchases will spend take a look at the store chart on your setting.

This is the store from Sequoia, the example setting.

### **Trivial Purchases**

Many common things characters will need are effectively free. The idea here is that each character has some way of paying for their adventures--usually a day-job or some savings--and they dip into this during the adventure and replenish it during downtime such that it comes out in the wash. Typically food, clothes, ammo, and lodging end up on the list of trivial purchases but a storyteller might want to make you sweat by making one of your basic needs non-trivial.

### **Minor Purchases**

The idea behind minor purchases is that while they aren't everyday purchases they are easy to get. Tools, weapons, vehicles, jewelry, and luxuries all typically fall into this category. You can convert your character's character points into minor purchases at a one-for-one ratio but you cannot typically convert them back. The minor purchase flavor can be used to pay for goods and services under the "minor" column of the setting's store. A character can have multiple copies of the minor purchase flavor.

### **Major Purchases**

Major purchases are very similar to minor purchases except that they are worth more. Typically, to obtain a major purchase, you will have to give the storyteller a hook for your character or give up a boon. The major purchase flavor can be used to pay for things in the "major" column of the setting's store. Leadership of an organization, elite training, property, and spaceships are all roughly the same value as the flavor major purchase. Furthermore, major purchases can also be used to pay off hooks or purchase new boons.

### **Impossible Purchases**

Lastly and of least importance we have impossible purchases. There isn't much to say here really. You typically can't obtain these things for one reason or another. They might be illegal, one-of-a-kind, insanely expensive, or simply non-existent in the setting.

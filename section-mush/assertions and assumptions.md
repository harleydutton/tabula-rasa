## assertions and assumptions
these are some things i believe to be true or assume will be true such that this game can function. this all should be moved to the intro to the doc or the intro to the storyteller section



### assumptions
I have realized I can't actually make this system without making some assumptions. I think these assumptions will be true for the majority of games this system is used in.
- the people of your setting use money
- characters have to eat; food and lodging is a nice baseline for currency
- the power level of armor and weapons will be roughly equivalent--no lightsabers vs plate mail

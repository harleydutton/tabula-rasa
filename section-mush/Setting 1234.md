A Setting is a template for worldbuilding. It includes a description of the world, the normal speed of characters in the world for timed actions like combat, the amount of character points new characters in the world start with, and a list of skills common within the Setting. The description includes the technological level, magic, history, spatial/geographic scope, flora, fauna, biomes, natural resources, items, culture, store, etc. of the World.

## **Action Delay**

The default Action Delay for the Setting is what all new characters in the Setting will start with. Typically this is 10. This will guarantee that most of the characters in the Setting are at about the same speed in scenes where timing matters like combat and chases. Because it is just a default and can be modified it also allows for some characters to be faster or slower than the average character.

## **What is not allowed**

This section is a multiple-choice questionnaire of common problematic elements within stories and whether or not each thing exists within the setting. This might be things like resurrection, undodgeable attack actions, and fast, long-range communications. Each element on this list should have a concept and a circleable descriptor indicating its availability within the setting. The storyteller should circle one descriptor for each and consider adding more entries. Sometimes entire game systems like crafting will be removed and this is intended.

mind control: exists | boon | taboo | lost | impossible
personal flight: exists | boon | taboo | lost | impossible
invisibility: exists | boon | taboo | lost | impossible
instant, long range communication i.e. cell phones: exists | boon | taboo | lost | impossible
undodgable attacks i.e. guns/explosions: exists | boon | taboo | lost | impossible
aoe attacks i.e. explosions or shooting multiple arrows from a bow: exists | boon | taboo | lost | impossible
teleportation: exists | boon | taboo | lost | impossible
reincarnation: exists | boon | taboo | lost | impossible
mind reading: exists | boon | taboo | lost | impossible
minions: exists | boon | taboo | lost | impossible
crafting: exists | boon | taboo | lost | impossible
agelessness: exists | boon | taboo | lost | impossible
super strength/speed: exists | boon | taboo | lost | impossible
letters of credit: exists | boon | taboo | lost | impossible
damage immunities i.e. incorporeality: exists | boon | taboo | lost | impossible
money as a superpower: exists | boon | taboo | lost | impossible

## **Starting Character Points**

Character points (CP) are a resource used by players throughout the game to take new Skills and Flavor and level up existing skills. The suggested starting character points for a setting is basically a recommendation for starting level. If characters start with 60 CP rather than 50 they will be a little stronger on average.

## **Skills**

Skills represent things a character can do. Each character within a setting has access to the same set of skills. Any character can learn these skills with storyteller approval either at character creation or during the story. Players are encouraged to suggest additions to the list of skills on the setting. A few examples of skills are sword-fighting, necromancy, seduction, and piloting. Skills can be purchased with CP at character creation and during the story by any character. Characters do not need to have every skill.

## **Technology and Magic Descriptions**

A couple of initial questions players usually have when they are making characters in a new setting are "Is there magic?" and "What is the technological level?" and for this reason the answers to these questions should be on the setting. They are commonly asked, important, and usually easy to answer. If there is any fictitious magic in the setting it should be described here.

## **Backgrounds**

A list of potential backgrounds could be useful. In a fantasy setting you will want to include all of the magical species here. If you feel the need to balance the versatility of magic out by giving it a downside you could include “magic user” as a background and use it to gatekeep and give downsides to magic. It is also worth listing which backgrounds are incompatible here. Typically players will want to add to this list.

Wizard - must be 30+ and a virgin
Vampire - catches on fire in the sun, needs to drink blood, pretty, strong, ageless etc.
Goblin - Bad reputation, short, ugly, don’t live long
Robot - Immune to electric and mental damage, cannot heal but can be repaired with crafting checks. Can modify body and knowledge easily. Needs to charge, doesn’t need to eat or sleep. Cannot be a wizard.

## **Store**

First off _the_ store doesn't really exist after character creation. Characters will have to go stores in the story to purchase things listed on _the_ store. Going to _a_ store within the story rather than _the_ store will drastically affect what is available for sale and maybe even what it is legal to trade. This is all subject to DTMS checks and storyteller approval after character creation. Anyway, _the_ store is set up as a series of priced columns. The flavor section describes the purchasing power of various pieces of flavor-money, also known as AUCs. The columns should be "Trivial", "Minor", "Major", and "impossible". Trivial purchases are effectively free, minor purchases are worth one CP, major purchases need to be roleplayed for or a deal needs to be struck, and impossible purchases are typically too expensive to ever purchase. Impossible purchases may become available through roleplaying. The columns of the store should all have things characters can purchase in/under them as reference points.

Trivial purchases are things like food, beer, candy, ammo, clothes, or entertainment. A minor purchase would be something that costs more a gun, car, specialized tool, computer, or medicine. Major purchases would be things like houses, companies, famous art, fancy cars, or a college education. Some impossible purchases would be space shuttles, whole countries, or world-famous art.

## **Tone**

It is typically a good idea to set expectations for the tone of the story such that people have the same expectations for the game and those expectations are met. It can ruin a scary story to have a bunch of goofy shit happening all the time. It can ruin a serious campaign to have a character named reginald fuck-hammer. Similarly it can ruin a goofy space-romp to have a character with a depressing or sinister history.

## **Social Description**

The social description for the setting should describe what the people of the setting are like and what they have done. This will be things like important places, institutions, cultural events, and historic events. This will also include the races/peoples/cultures within the setting and the countries and governments they have formed.

## **Physical Description**

The physical description for the setting should describe what the land itself is like (assuming there is land). This would be things like geography, weather, plants, and animals. This should also include scope; how large an area does this description cover? A city? A country? A continent? A planet? A map will supplement this description nicely. The spatial scope can be the entire known universe or just the part the characters are in right now. A rough idea of how big it is will always help players wrap their heads around it though.

## **Theme**

Each setting has a theme. It might be the wild west with cowpokes getting into brawls and lobbing dynamite off of trains. It might be an epic swords and sorceries adventure. It might be a modern day espionage story with lots of gunfights and back alley deals. It might be the far flung future with spaceships battling around every asteroid. The point is that players should try to match their characters to the theme of the setting as well as they can. Usually the storyteller doesn't enjoy telling you you cannot play a wizard in the story about space pirates.

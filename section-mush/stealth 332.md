At some point I though spot checks were unnecessary. AT THE ITME i was fine with players rolling spot checks for info anyway if they were stuck in a roleplaying situation.
In previous versions I defined words for describing stealth scenes. Hider and Seeker were prevalent. This language sounds dumb. the concept might be sound though. observer? stealther? "to remain hidden a character..." "to detect a hidden character..." "the hidden character..." "the ?seeking/observing? character..."

#### there are some good concepts for stealth here
tl;dr definition, partial stealth, entering and joining from stealth, acting from stealth can cause alert or detection
***
Stealth is where a character hides themselves from other characters. This can be accomplished with magic as well as cunning.
Full stealth is where no one knows where a character is except that characterâ€™s allies. Entering a chase or combat from full stealth grants 10 bonus initiative.
Partial stealth is being hidden relative to some characters but visible to others. Entering a chase or combat from partial stealth grants 5 bonus initiative.
Attempting to enter stealth from a chase or combat costs an action, a stealth check, and somewhere to hide.
To stay hidden whilst doing something that could potentially reveal his or her location a character should roll additional stealth checks.

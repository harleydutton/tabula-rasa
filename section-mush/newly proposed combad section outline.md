combat (description, warning regarding death, and intended difficulty of killing blows)
  timing
    mechanics of the action economy and global turn ticker
    transitions (starting, ending, changing combat)
  actions (major, minor/move, reaction, free)
    attacking, damage and dying (this feels like it doesn't fit well)
  war? (too preachy? include in the intent for combat?)

I think maybe just use this section to describe combat as a system for handling timed actions
and deal with attacking and death in another (sub)section

Because it affects a number of systems I think it might be a good idea to put in checks that "the last action to be rolled as a success decides what happens" or something similar. reactions beat actions, resistance beats persuasion, and seeing beats stealth.

how should difficulties be formatted. update the legend.

NPC     PLAYER      NPC
sneak   perception  
        sneak       perception

Should the player always get a roll? include target difficulites for sneak?
suggest having enemies always fail their sneak checks?

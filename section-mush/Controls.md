[[Veto]] is where the [[section-mush/Storyteller]] can shut down things a [[section-mush/Player]] is trying to put in the [[section-mush/Story]] or [[section-mush/Setting]].

[[What is not allowed]] is a placeholder name for part of the [[section-mush/Setting]] that will define what magic, tech, flavor and skills [[section-mush/Player]]s can put on their [[Character 1]]s.

[[Storyteller Discretion]] is a mythical magical substance I haven't defined anywhere but have referenced more than a few times.

[[DTMS]] and [[Does This Make Sense]] are placeholders I have referencing the idea that the [[section-mush/Storyteller]] should be able to shut down some shit the [[section-mush/Player]]s are doing while roleplaying.

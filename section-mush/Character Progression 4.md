Characters usually get stronger over the course of a story. They can acquire new skills, level up the existing ones, and get new flavor and thatâ€™s what this section is all about.

### **Character Point Acquisition**

Character points (CP) are given out by the storyteller at character creation and usually at the end of each session. CP are typically awarded for good roleplaying and completing story objectives. The storyteller should keep a running total on the setting document of how many CP have been given out to the group.

### **Flavor Acquisition**

Your character will acquire flavor throughout the story for mostly for free. You can, however, pay for it in the same way as you would during character creation. Hooks and boons can be acquired through roleplaying, items in the minor purchase category can be obtained from stores where available, and temporary flavor in the form of wounds are the natural result of combat. Beware, actions have consequences and sometimes flavor will be inflicted upon you.

#### **Crafting**

In Tabula, crafting an item is just a skill check. Describe what you want and how you plan on using your crafting skill to get it, ask the storyteller what the difficulty is, and make the roll. If you succeed you get the desired item, likely with some narrative flair. If you fail you do not get what you asked for, any materials and time put into the crafting roll are lost, and it is possible something bad happens.

### **Skill Acquisition**

Skills can be learned from other characters in the story. If a skill is fairly simple or if a character is fairly dedicated they can learn it on their own. Dedicated characters can also create new skills and add them to the setting--once again, only with storyteller approval. The first level of any new skill costs one character point. All skill acquisitions need to pass a DTMS check.

### **Skill Progression**

Leveling up skills can happen at any time and requires character points (CP). The CP cost varies by level and type of skill. Attributes are significantly more expensive than skills to level up.

#### **Attribute Progression**

The attributes are Body, Mind, Spirit and Social. The cost to level an attribute is the desired level squared in CP. If you wish to raise an attribute more than one level at a time you must still pay for the intermediate levels.

#### **Skill Progression**

The cost to level is the desired level in CP. If you with to level a skill more than one level at a time you must pay for the intermediary levels too.

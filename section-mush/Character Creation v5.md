## Character Creation
<!-- I need a link to the setting section.
    I should to talk about what a character needs to be non-mechanically playable-->
Characters need skills, flavor and an action delay to be playable. The first thing a player should do when making a character is take a look at the setting, read through it and make sure they understand the world. Players can propose things be added to the setting because they are supposed to have a mild influence upon what exists within the setting.

First fill out the top of your character sheet. In order, the boxes should contain the character's name, the character's concept, the setting's name, your name, and the setting's action delay. A character concept can be thought of as the canonical or stereotypical version of something. The setting's action delay can be found in the upper left corner of the setting template.

Second, your character needs [skills](#skills). Skills are used to roll checks which is how a character interacts with the game world. Skills are usually self-descriptively named and have levels. The higher level the skill the better at it a character is.
There are two kinds of skills. Mandatory skills and the normal kind. Mandatory skills are skills every character _needs_ within the setting. They are listed at the top of the skills section in the setting. Add all of the mandatory skills to your character sheet. The rest of the skills are those that are common within the setting and you can take any of them you can afford. Players can also propose to the storyteller that skills be added to the setting. You pay for your starting skills using character points. Starting character points are listed in the upper left of the setting. Both types of skill cost a number of character points equal to the level you want the skill to start at.
```
Example mandatory skills: willpower, strength, magic, dexterity, charisma
Example skills: sword fighting, pyromancy, computer hacking, seduction
```

Third, your character needs [flavor](#flavor). Flavor is a word or short phrase describing a character. It can include knowledge, possessions, physique, and even social position. Review the starting flavor options listed on the setting. This will almost always give your character a language, clothes, and equipment relevant for the setting. When the setting specifies a type of flavor but not what it is specifically you get to choose something that would fit within the setting. Add your choice of starting flavor to your character sheet. Afterward, add flavor to your character to describe them. Flavor costs one character point per after you have your starting flavor. Flavor is usually just that, flavor, but occasionally it can make checks easier or harder.

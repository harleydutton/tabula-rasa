### flavor
IIRC flavor was short descriptive words or phrases that would give +1 or -1 in situations in which they applied. Ciazio stacked "strong" worded a few different ways and had a +4. balance this.
"flavor" is a short description of anything a character knows, owns, has or is (including reputation, status, and position). these should be the videogame equivalent of passives rather than actives. they can modify checks by a small value but they are not check themselves.
flavor is anything a character is or has: physical attributes (horns, fins, cybernetic implants), magical, social, mental, or a material possessions.
flavor should not have numbers attached to it.
flavor can be acquired at CC and either purchased with exp or acquired through roleplaying.
Duplicate flavor should not stack for determining modifiers for checks. Unique flavors should. (strong, buff, muscley = +1 vs big, strong = +2 to a strength check or something)
At one point i had something named traits/passive abilities/backgrounds. these were very, very similar to flavor. they cannot be leveled up and they cannot be taught. those two restrictions were important for defining what was and was not a trait and it could be useful for defining flavor.

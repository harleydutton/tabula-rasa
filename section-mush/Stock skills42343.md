### Stock Skills
All characters should have the ability to attack, defend, move, hide, see, lie, detect lies, persuade, resist persuasion and much more.
Skills are all made up and characters should be able to do each of these things with their skills. probably more things too. Settings should include a list of stock/common skills. PC-made skills need tohave descriptive names. Other (stock/common) skills should have standardized names for DM sanity.

- obsidian
	- can I make tables? how? Pipes and dashes
	- can I leave comments? how?C-//
- Prep work
	- Do a readthrough
		- Try to move comments here. They are hard to think about when they are scattered hell to breakfast in the main doc.
	- I would like to see a better ToC than the one in the sidebar. How?
	- Digraphs, promises, and ALLCAPS. 
	- Read the previous version too, at the very least to figure out what happened to the title art.
	- Consider splitting out the major sections into separate documents.
- Sections to add
	- Fatigue system
	- Bulk system
	- Morality system
	- [[Storyteller]] v [[player]] v [[character]] v npc section
	- [[Storyteller]] discretion
	- Attributes section
	- Assisted checks
	- Actions
		- In addition all reactions occur after the action that caused them.
		- Big actions can be converted to littler actions (attack -> move)
		- Timing
			- Subsections: Downtime, Conflict, and normal adventuring time/storytelling time. usually “scenes” will be my descriptive unit here.
- Section specific gripes
	- Timing
		- Define actions in the timing section. All of them. main/major action, reaction, minor, free, move, held action, extended action, offhand, mental, etc. see existing combat section/todo
	- Distance
		- rename battlefields to something less combat oriented
		- switch the distance and movement sections. make it clear in the distance section that the system does not determine weapon ranges or the like
	- Hidden Information
		- rename unsuspicious to oblivious
		- rename undetected to hidden
		- say somewhere that moving in stealth requires stealth rolls
		- I should make it clear that undetectable is not a state but rather a difficulty modifier in this system. context: invisible rogue and guard who may or may not have true sight.
	- [[Character]] sheet
		- Should include a money and items section to track spent income, purchases, current wealth, etc.
	- skills
		- taking new skills acts as an unlock. some actions are only possible if you actually have the relevant [[skill]]. mandatory skills don't work for everything. 
		- Restrictions on when you can learn new skills. Need training, need downtime, etc.
		- define skills better. Possible Heuristic: skills allow you to do
		- add an example to [[scope]]: fireball, fire magic, magic
	- Flavor
		- rename flavor to be countable (flavor is uncountable)
		- define flavor better. Heuristic: flavor represents thing you are or have
		- flavor cannot point to a specific [[skill]]. If a flavor boils down to "+1 to a [[skill]]" or "X [[skill]] is easy for me" it isn't really flavor. Instead it should have many ups and downs and they should be situational.
		- Define more flavor systems than just money and items. What does it mean to be a species? What does it mean to have knowledge? What does reputation mean? Inherent spiritual, mental or physical attributes?
	- Combat
		- What the heck do defences look like these days?
		- round based conflict using action economy. series of opposed checks. synchronous as opposed to async.
		- damage
			- probably need a more generic attack modifiers list. also something that will work in mental or [[social]] combat. I.e. Making an attack hard to evade is difficulty hard. Other mods include multitarget, lethal, feint, etc.
			- [[Health]] and damage system as currently imagined (physical; adapt for mental/[[social]]. Spiritual [[health]] tracks morality)
			- [[body]] is a [[character]]’s capacity to receive wounds (flavor) before going unconscious.
			- [[storyteller]] represents characters as weak/vulnerable/bloody once they have [[body]]-1 wounds.
			- some flavor can be bigger maybe? Mortal wounds?
			- characters with wounds equal to [[body]] are incapacitated. [[Storyteller]] discretion as to what happens to them
			- characters with more wounds than [[body]] die
	- [[Character]] Creation
		- at [[skill]]/flavor creation, discuss power level as a limiting factor. it should be a consideration at the least.
		- at [[skill]]/flavor creation, discuss the typical use case and difficulty.
		- Make sure [[character]] creation, the “[[character]]” section (if it exists), and the [[character]] sheet (which I’m pretty sure doesn’t yet) all match up. Think about how I might make it so I only have to make updates to what a [[character]] is in one place. (perhaps split systems and definitions like I did in [[Sark Douls]])
	- [[Sequoia]]
		- Update store using the one found in Money and Items
		- The example [[setting]] doc should define its own currency. I think it does. [[Sequoia]] uses amber and aether to my knowledge.
	- [[Setting]]
		- Should I include system switches as part of the settings doc? (morality, money, fatigue, bulk, etc)
		- The [[setting]] should define the currency

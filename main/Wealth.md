Wealth is guaranteed stat like speed and attributes that represents a character's [[Money and Items]].

At [[Downtime]], the sum of a [[Character]]s [[Currency]], [[Assets]], and [[Expenses]] will trend back towards their wealth. 

A character's method of currency [[Income]] is a big part of what their wealth is or the shape it takes. I'm not sure if I want wealth to be a number or a bunch of flavor yet. It needs to be used as a number. It probably makes the most sense to just have it be a number.



Dumping this here from temp because I think this is going to be the top level section:
Was somewhere in the process of reworking [[Money and Items]]. Could I rename it? It involves liquid currency, assets and expenses. Rename the section "wealth" perhaps? This is the stat characters would be leveling.
Assets and Expenses go together.
liquid currency =  wealth - (assets + expenses)
liquid currency should trend toward this formula 
`liquid currency =  wealth - (assets + expenses)`

Setting specific currency is currency is money. Should I remove one of money/currency from that chain? It's more natural to talk about as money.

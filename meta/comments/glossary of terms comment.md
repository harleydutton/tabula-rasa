Is this useful or should the implicit answer to what is X be "Google it"?

I think it is useful, but prominently where your definition differs from other folks definitions, and when your are going to reference that specific definition in the future.

For what it is worth, i don't think i would have many of the ones you have necessarily, but i would probably have things like [flavor, mandatory, available, skills] and other keywords in your system.

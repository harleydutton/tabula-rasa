any guard 'could' detect them, even off duty ones
--stefan

This line is intended to bring attention to situations like an invisible rogue and a guard who might or might not have true sight.
--harley

for me that more resembles undetectable, not undetected aka if the thief has in some way made perception against them 'impossible'
--stefan

I should make it clear that undetectable is not a state but rather a difficulty modifier in this system.
--harley

looking forward to it

I am surprised you haven't commented on this yet. Do character creation in the beginning and this section feel the same? Do you think they should be put together? It was useful for organizing my thoughts to think of "character definition" and "character creation" as separate--and setting definition and setting creation. Does this cause confusion to the reader or is a useful distinction?

I think that to some degree they are the same section, but also to some degree it is the example of the systems/flavor. in the sense of  
Flavor - things that the player should know, and probably write down somewhere but don't have any mechanical effect (my character is a gruff biker but he has a some spot for 'my little ponies') 
Systems - the actual in game, probability model affecting or affected stats, that you 'must' document (aforementioned biker has 4 body and 2 spirit... )

The second half of that is there is probably something allong the lines of a 'for new players character creation', that you could likely do in one page(this section), and a 'full version' (the other section)

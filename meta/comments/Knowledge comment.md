i am pretty sure that in most cases knowledge's would always be more powerful (1 cp to lower difficulty will always be better than 1+cp to add a dice) as a flavor, but i think similarly they would always be better represented (it would make more sense in system) as a skill.

I'm pretty sure this either shouldn't be a thing or it should be the only relevant way to represent specific knowledge's

knowledge is intended to make checks in specialized domains possible (difficulty change from impossible to normal)

I suppose I should make that clear.

Knowing Spanish vs knowing how to do surgery. One is binary and one is gradient. One enables you to speak with Spanish speakers and one is how likely you are to be able to surgerize someone effectively.

so 'knowing' something is a knowledge(flavor) and 'knowing how to do' something is a skill?
similarly what is the difference between the skill 'knows how to do surgery' and 'surgery'?

I believe that this is another example of a dramatic shift in tone. you have stopped talking to a DM but you are still not talking to the generic 'player' you are specifically talking to the 'new' player as far as I can tell.

so, there is a "character creation" section and a "character" section. They have different purposes.

The "character" section (this one) is intended to define a character. It should describe all the necessary parts of a character and nothing else.

On the other hand  the "character creation" section (near the beginning of the doc) is intended to help a new player create a character as fast as possible.

I know I need a character creation section. I am unsure if the overlap has rendered this section useless or detrimental. Thoughts?

perhaps the character section is just for me and belongs in another document somewhere...

as far as them having a different purpose I would think about a few things.
1 who are you writing this for.
2 what is the purpose of the section.
3 how is it different from any other section.

you have told me who you are talking to (the player) and as for as i can tell its purpose is to be shorter(?) than the section above. based on those two things i don't actually know if it is different than the section above.
 
To that end I think this section probably did have purpose that was different from above, but you probably need to figure out if it still does, or what it was in the first place

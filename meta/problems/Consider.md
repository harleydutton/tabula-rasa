This note catches all the backlinks to things I am thinking about doing. I think this might be some variation of the [[No More TODOs]] problem.

I think I should probably not have any of that shit in-line and it should be moved to the design section so it can eventually be evaluated against the pillars, and either implemented or rejected.

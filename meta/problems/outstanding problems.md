DEATH BY FLAVOR: When does a character die? (when they gain a flavor that would kill them. use DTMS checks) When they have a certain number of bad flavors? (no, not by number) Who determines what flavor can be added to a character? (called shots, the player) Perhaps we should just have health? (no) How do you determine when a character has accumulated enough flavor that they are unconscious or dead? (DTMS check) This can probably be solved by saying the difficulty for giving immediately lethal flavor will usually be high against non-mooks unless you have silver bullets. Unconscious, sleeping, incapacitated, downed, etc. characters can be killed outright. When a character achieves the downed status from wounds is based on a DTMS check I guess? Not having source material makes combat messy... When moving is non-trivial (on the trivial, easy, normal, hard, impossible subjective check difficulty scale) a character is downed? When attacking is impossible a character can be considered impotent/incapacitated and initiative can be dropped.

working on [[Character 1]], therefore working on [[Skills]], therefore working on [[Limits]] in [[section-mush/Setting]] and [[Setting Creation and Evolution]]

I have come to some realizations. I don't think tabula rasa is a worldbuilding framework. I think it is more like an interface defining the minimum attributes any world must have in order to be playable with this system.

to this end I have actually been working on better defining **Setting**

I think I need to define both a global and local setting framework so I have the mental clarity to proceed.

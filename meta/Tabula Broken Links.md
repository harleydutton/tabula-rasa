After pruning this list down I think I do want to create most of these files. Similarly I need to flesh out some of these empty files too.

empty files:
- [[sections/storyteller/Setting Creation.md]]
- [[sections/secrets/terms/Observer.md]]
- [[sections/damage/Passive Defences.md]]
- [[sections/conflict/actions/Active Defenses.md]]
- [[sections/character/sheet/back of sheet/Demeanor.md]]
- [[sections/character/sheet/back of sheet/Drawing.md]]
- [[sections/character/sheet/back of sheet/Concept.md]]

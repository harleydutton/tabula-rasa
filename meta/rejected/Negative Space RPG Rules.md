An observation as an extension of that critique: consider a view of D&D that views it not as a system of rules that allows and recommends and guides you in a way, but as a system constructed entirely from negative space. D&D written and interpreted in such a way that it only ever tells you where you _can't_ tread. You can't use that spell with that class. You can't use that spell without a spell slot. You can't have that spell slot with that level. You can't speak that language with that background. It's still... "turing complete", whether the rules are positive or negative. **You've constructed an RPG system where the meaningful negotiation about the world (and the characters... and the story...) exists in negative space.** And what I hear in the response above is "Don't worry about the RPG system (negative space guidelines), I'll get around to it just as soon as I've finished figuring out the RPG system (description of how my RPG will work)." And that's why I keep saying that I don't (yet) see a system here, just a thought exercise. Because that thing that doesn't exist yet is all the meat AND THE BONES - and what I see now is just a long, elaborate TODO note to figure that out. More distressing to me still, I can't tell if you want Tabula to have RPG rules, or just to have metaguidelines for them. If it's just guidelines, I'm not sure where your unique distinguishing factor is - the thing that enables DM / player content negotiation that couldn't happen in any other system.

I will agree that I am at least partially leaving things undefined and a lot of how I am having storytellers approach [[Limits]] is through negative space. to this end this system is trying to be that, but mostly for the negotiation of content, not mechanics.

I don't think this leads to a design decision. rejected.

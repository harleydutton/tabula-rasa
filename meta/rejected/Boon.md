**Boons** are the extra powerful version of flavor. Boons can only be obtained through [[Hooks]]. Boons allow characters to be abnormally large, a powerful non-human, unusually rich or famous, or have a magic skill, or some smart, loyal minions. Boons can also be exchanged for a renewable [major purchase](#major-purchases).

Boons are the exception to the rules when it comes to flavor and skills. Specifically a boon lets you have a skill or flavor marked as “boon” in the [what is not allowed](#_5nz680a5nyup) section of the world document. If something there is marked as “boon” your character needs a boon to be or have it. In a world that has none perhaps your character has uncovered the secret to magic or firearms or telecommunication. Boons can only be obtained through hooks and they are usually related. Boons can also be exchanged for a renewable major purchase.

Boons, on the other hand, are rewards that are unobtainable except through hooks and roleplaying. Both hooks and boons can be anything but usually end up being flavor. The storyteller must agree to grant you the boon you want or either of the boon and major purchase flavors for the hook you are offering; be reasonable. The flavors boon and major purchase are equal in value and can be converted. Speak with your storyteller to trade these flavors for boons or things from the major purchase column of the world's store.

- If I decide to keep using [[Boon|Boons]] they should be starred on the character sheet--literally draw a star next to them to mark them.

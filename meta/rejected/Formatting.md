Formatting decisions that I explicitly want readers to pay attention to will be in a legend in the getting started section.

does it make sense to include a [[Legend]]? no, why is below

I think it might be a bit pointless. In terms of accessability, everything I write should **just make sense**. If something needs the legend it isn't accessible. if nothing needs the legend, the legend is useless. rejected.

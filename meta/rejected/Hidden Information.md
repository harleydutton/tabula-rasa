Hidden information in roleplaying games can range from lying, to sneaking up on someone, to hiding things. Hidden info is a source of tension and surprise but resolving can be tricky. The way I like to think about it there are two roles when talking about hidden information. One is the thief, the character going around hiding information. The other is the guard, the character trying to discover this information. The information the thief hides can be undiscovered or discovered. The guard can be suspicious or unsuspicious. Because it will almost certainly come up, it is worth noting that the difficulty of checks related to hidden information should be disclosed by default but doesn't have to be revealed before or even after the check is made. Whenever the thief wishes to hide info or change hidden info they need to make a check.

Tabula Rasa treats all of stealth, mind-reading, lies, plots, locks, lying, etc. as essentially the same thing: secrets. A secret is a piece of information at least one [[big Character master copy|character]] is trying to keep hidden from other characters.

Uses the name "Secrets" rather than "Hidden Information" or "Stealth and Lying"

the idea is sound but this is poorly written and should go in the trash where it belongs. rejected.

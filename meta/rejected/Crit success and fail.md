### Critical Success and Failure
When you roll the maximum or minimum values on the check dice you get a crit. The roll automatically succeeds or fails and maybe some good/bad stuff happens.

This no longer makes sense for this system with the existing check system. VTM style botch for crit fail might work (any ones and no successes). 

not sure what to do about crit successes. The current system is that one success is a partial success and two is a perfect success. perhaps three could be a crit success? perhaps multiple 6's or wildly higher than necessary MOS could be crits.

[[The Event Die]] is a version of a crit system that is independent of the player's roll. Furthermore the VTM style botch is one that players often don't understand fully and I don't really want any MOS above two to be interpreted at all. Rejected.

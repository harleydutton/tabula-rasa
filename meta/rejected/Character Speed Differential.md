this system doesn't have a good way to give players additional actions by default. it also doesn't have a good way to represent that one character is slower than the rest except by making all the other players in the combat faster. furthermore meaningful speed differences aren't usually fun in combat. therefore this system has all characters acting at about the same speed. additional actions can still be granted at the DM's discretion.

with the current iteration of the combat system, characters can get marginally faster but cannot get slower. I think this is fine. I don't see why anyone would want to get slower. I think it's fine to reject the notion that I need to implement a system to make players slower than normal.

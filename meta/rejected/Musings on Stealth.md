stealth: i am basing this bit on stealth games i have played. if you fail a stealth check you arent detected (except maybe on a crit). instead you do something that puts the "seekers" on alert and they start looking for you. if they pass their relevant observation checks THEN you get detected. If you pass your stealth check and the seekers start looking for you anyway then you can be detected if you are detectable. IF you are undetectable you cannot be detected but you can alert the seekers that you are there.

this is a very prescriptive, inflexible way to do stealth.

Undetectable is not a state but rather a difficulty modifier in this system. If you can't see invisible dudes, you have absolutely no hope of noticing an invisible guy robbing your convenience store.

This could be a thief state but it makes far more sense as a difficulty modifier. perhaps I should make note of this in weird checks? I think this doesn't need to be included unless it comes up as a problem. rejected.

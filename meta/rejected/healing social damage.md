1. leave the area (guaranteed)
2. wait (random)
3. patch things up (roleplay)

social health:
- social damage is super localized
	- leaving the area makes the damage not count against your total
	- doing stuff to fix your bad rep can fix it
	- time *can* fix bad rep
		- can be done on downtime
		- event die
			- 6 clears up bad rep
			- 5-2 group forgets, individual remembers
			- 1 group remembers too
			- does this healing system work for other health systems?
		- check
			- what check though? social? something time related?
			- perfect success clears up bad rep
			- partial success grudge by individual
			- failure still have bad rep with group

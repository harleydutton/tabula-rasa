Actions can be converted downward.
- [[Main Action]] to [[Supporting Action]]
- [[Supporting Action]] to [[Reaction]] would leave you with two reactions and an action, which is useless.
- [[Reaction]]s cannot be converted down.

I think I don't want there to be conversion but I do like the action of a main and supporting action. rejected.

Even though the mandatory skills should have you covered having some way to attack, defend, sense, communicate, and disagree is a good idea.

For physical skills athletics, acrobatics, endurance, and weapon skills are all fairly useful. For mental skills intelligence, memory, and willpower are all quite useful. Spirit is optional but if your storyteller is allowing magic you should pick a magic school so you can do more interesting magic. For social skills bartering, persuasion, seduction, lying, leadership, and intimidation are all classics.

I don't think recommended skills are a good idea. If something is important enough to be a recommended skill it should be an attribute.

Per [[No Roleplaying Tips]], recommended skills are a bad idea. It might be okay to let the storyteller know they can add new attributes (skills everyone has) to the game. I think that second thing is better covered by [[Mandatory Skills]]. rejected.

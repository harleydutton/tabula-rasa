I think in the past this was how I wanted to go about making a generic system. I think this is fine in moderation though. I am currently thinking I want to use charts/tables to represent feature flags or the settings store.

The main thing I wanted to get away from was creating content myself. I feel like I have a much better handle on how to create a generic system these days and this is an outdated heuristic.

> A: I hit for 15
> B: I hit the dragon for 7 and trip the dragon
> DM: The dragon hits A for 32
> C: I hit for 13
> DM: hurray, you killed the dragon

This is very dull with comparison to
> A: I shoulder check the wyvern and grab one of it's legs
> B: I pry up some of the scales on it's breast
> DM: the dragon bats A away with it's foreleg
> C: I run up and sink my dagger into the dragons heart
> DM: hurray, you killed the dragon

how can I accomplish this? perhaps something in 

[[Dramatic]]

I think this largely translates to "removing all the numbers and crunchy bullshit emergently has created more dramatic combat" and nothing needs to be done. rejected.

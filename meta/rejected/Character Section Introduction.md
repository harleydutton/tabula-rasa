[[meta/comments/Character comments]]
This chapter is for you, the Player. Characters are representations of the fictional people within the Setting. To be mechanically playable, your character needs an action delay, a motivation, skills, flavor and a number of other shit.

I don't think I care about introducing the Character section to the player. The Character section is just the definition of an abstract concept. What the player really needs is a [[Getting started]] page specific to them... and now we have that: [[Getting Started as a Player]]. rejected.

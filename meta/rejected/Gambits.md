Gambits are where you make a deal with the storyreller to modify the the difficulty of a check, the pass-effect, and the fail-effect. You might ask for something special to happen on a success in exchange for an increase in difficulty.

Retry mechanics can save a novice storyteller's bacon. they can create tension. they make players more likely to succeed. they implicitly check attempts, or at least I would have them do so.

I don't care for this as a check modifier, because I want to keep the check process streamlined. I potentially like it as a retry mechanic rather than a difficulty modifier storytellers can offer.

If it were to work similar to the retry mechanic in call of cthulhu, it would be "when a player fails a check they can attempt to retry. They must attempt the check in a different way, possibly using a different skill. If the storyteller is not impressed with the description of the alternate attempt they can veto it. For a retry to be attempted, the storyteller must consider what the original failure state would have been and make something worse to be the new failure state."

Writing all that out I realize it will slow down play in all cases because the storyteller must wait for the players to choose to retry or not. Rejected.

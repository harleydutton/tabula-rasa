In Dragon Age (3d6 system) if two dice showed the same face you got as many stunt points as the face of  the "dragon die" (one of them was red I think). I could use [[The Event Die]] for this. I'm probably not interested in making the table of stunts though.

This opposes the pillar of being [[Generic]]

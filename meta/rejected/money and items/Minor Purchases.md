The idea behind minor purchases is that while they aren't everyday purchases they are easy to get. Tools, weapons, vehicles, jewelry, and luxuries all typically fall into this category. You can convert your character's character points into minor purchases at a one-for-one ratio but you cannot typically convert them back. The minor purchase flavor can be used to pay for goods and services under the "minor" column of the setting's store. A character can have multiple copies of the minor purchase flavor.

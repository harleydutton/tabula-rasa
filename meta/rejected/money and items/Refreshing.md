Some of you may be concerned that if you convert boons and CP to items and then  lose them your character will be weaker forever. Fear not! Purchases refresh at the beginning of downtime. Specifically, at the beginning of downtime if you have fewer cheap items and minor purchases than minor purchasing power, you get minor purchases equal to the difference. The same is true of expensive items, major purchases and major purchasing power.

On regular intervals, usually during [[Narrated Scene]], the sum of a character's liquid currency and items should change to match their wealth stat. Usually this will cause characters to receive currency for their used, broken, and lost equipment such that they can make new purchases. This can however cause characters to lose currency or even items if they don't have a high enough wealth score.

Some of you may be concerned that if you convert boons and CP to items and then lose them your character will be weaker forever. Fear not! Purchases refresh at the beginning of downtime. Specifically, at the beginning of downtime if you have fewer combined cheap items and units of minor currency than out have minor purchasing power, you get units of minor currency equal to the difference. The same is true of expensive items, units of major currency and major purchasing power. The idea here is that not all of your time within the story is accounted for and while the camera isnâ€™t on you, you are trending back toward your typical level of wealthare doing something profitable.

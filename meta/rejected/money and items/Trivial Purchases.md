Many common things characters will need are effectively free so as to avoid pointless bookkeeping. The idea here is that each character has some way of paying for their adventures, and that when they get back home, they have a roof over their head and food in their belly because _something_ they do is profitable, either back home or on the road. Typically food, clothes, ammo, and lodging end up on the list of trivial purchases but a storyteller might want to make you sweat by making one of your basic needs non-trivial.

A night of role playing usually lasts anywhere from two to six hours and includes a variety of scenes: Exhilarating chases, nail-biting espionage, terrifying battles, grand speeches, descriptions of exotic lands, and, of course, joking around in and out of character are all hallmarks of good roleplaying.

One player will need to be the storyteller. The storyteller is largely responsible for running the game. A storyteller's responsibilities include setting up scenes between characters, planning and narrating events that drive the story, roleplaying NPCs, setting check difficulties, and managing the setting. Once a storyteller is chosen they should go take a look at the [setting](https://github.com/harleydutton/Tabula-Rasa/blob/develop/tabula-rasa.md#setting) section and either create or find a setting for their story.

Everyone else will be a player. Players should go straight to the [character creation](https://github.com/harleydutton/Tabula-Rasa/blob/develop/tabula-rasa.md#character-creation) section and begin creating characters using the setting provided by the storyteller. Once a player has a character, they will provide voice acting, motivations, and personality for the character in addition to controlling their actions in the story.

Most good stories include conflict. Once you have a storyteller, a setting, a story, and a character for each player you will need to know how to resolve conflicts. Conflicts are usually between characters (both player and non-player) and when they arise they can be resolved by rolling [checks](https://github.com/harleydutton/Tabula-Rasa/blob/develop/tabula-rasa.md#check). Everyone should make sure they understand how checks work.

To start an Adventure you will need a few things. First and most important, your group will need a Setting so they can do character creation. You can use one of the included Settings, find one online, or make your own by filling out the Setting template. Otherwise you need paper, pencils, six-sided dice, and players. A printer and having your adventure planned out are both highly recommended. Once you have these things proceed to the Character Creation section.
<!-- the bit below needs to be written into the bit above -->
1. The storyteller should visit the [setting](# setting) to create a setting for the story to take place in. 
2. Players should visit the [character creation](#character-creation) section.
3. The storyteller should head over to the [making an adventure](#making-an-adventure) section if they need help with that.
<!--I think a map, a battlegrid, tokens, and cards might also be helpful depending the other rules I include-->

both the player and the storyteller are going to need getting started pages that are relevant to them. This page is redundant with [[Tabula home page]]. rejected.

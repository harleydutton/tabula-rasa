Mental influence is when a character uses magic or some other plot device to subvert the will of the **mark**. The best example is `mind control` but others are `madness`, `illusions`, and `emotion magic`.

---

Social influence is when the **salesman** uses their demeanor and way with words to convince the **mark** to do their will. The skills `persuasion`, `seduction`, `bartering`, `intimidation` and of course the `social` attribute are the usual suspects.

---

When one character uses a skill to make another character do something the first character is exerting their influence. These situations can quickly break the game or make it unenjoyable unless there is counter play. This section defines a system for resolving these situations. For this section the **salesman** will be the character exerting influence and the **mark** will be the target of their influence.

<!-- Should mental and social influence be combined? I think they should... -->

you can only defend if you know you are being attacked. if we have attributes all characters get a check against persuasion. otherwise they don't unless they have a relevant skill.

---

this is a good time to mention that when you try to convince a character of something they dont _have_ to be convinced. instead they can thing about it a bit and roll some relevant "resist persuasion" rolls which probably uses __willpower__.

this is just going to be an opposed check. rejected.

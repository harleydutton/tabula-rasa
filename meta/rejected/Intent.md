It isn't intended to be fair, realistic, or deep. It is intended to be dramatic (and fun). Like the rest of the system players can have their characters do anything they think of. This means players can say "I would like to shoot that robot in the power core" with the reasonable expectation that the robot will be incapacitated if they they pass their `shooting` check. There are two problems with this. First, suddenly gaining the `death` flavor is well and good for henchmen but big-bad-evil-guys need time to monologue and should always be dealt the `dying` flavor instead. Second, again instant death is fine for henchmen but bosses and players should be harder to kill.

The intent is to make it hard to kill named characters before their defences have been lowered. Once the boss robot's force field has been shorted out with a bucket of water then can be dealt some form of the `dying` flavor at normal difficulty and finished off as an action or once combat ends. 
<!-- this should be a BRIEF description of combat and a more lengthy description of why it is necessary -->

Core gameplay loops common in TTRPGs which I might want to accommodate in order to remain [[Generic]].

- combat game loop: explore, fight, loot, sell (combat, encounters, loot)
- social game loop: schedule, meeting, gossip (group character creation, petitioner and granter)
- growth game loop: problem, exclusive choice, growth, time passes (character progression tree, motivations)
- generational game loop: problem, exclusive choice, new generation, world changes
- travel game loop: exclusive choice, travel, encounter, gain/lose resources (travel, resources, motivations)

I have no intention to declare any core gameplay loop so this is pointless. As much as I like having this all written out, I don't need it here and it is clogging up the works. rejected.

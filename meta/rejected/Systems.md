At this point this is just a text snippet for if I want to make a monolith doc AND i want to group all the systems together. with the current method of displaying tabula as a wiki, this isn't necessary.

This section goes into detail on the typical systems involved in roleplaying games and how this game chooses to represent them. This game draws inspiration from a number of other popular roleplaying games but even, some of these will be far from the norm given that this is a generic system and we cannot assume any source material to reference for skills, items, monsters, etc.

This isn't going into the [[Wiki not Book]] version of tab. I the [[Tabula home page]] will have all the sections listed but even then I won't need this snippet. rejected.

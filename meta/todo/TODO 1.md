- Sections to add
	- [[Storyteller]] v [[Player]] v [[Character 1]] v npc section
	- sleep/rest/fatigue
	- morality (spiritual damage?)
	- healing
	- system of measures (pinch, handful, swallow, etc.)
	- inventory capacity/ bulk
	- travel on the world map
	- insight (detect lies/emotions)
- Section specific gripes
	- Timing
		- Define actions in the timing section. All of them. main/major action, reaction, minor, free, move, held action, extended action, offhand, mental, etc. see existing combat section/todo
		- Big actions can be converted to littler actions (attack -> move)
		- In addition all reactions occur after the action that caused them.
	- Hidden Information
		- say somewhere that moving in stealth requires stealth rolls
		- I should make it clear that undetectable is not a state but rather a difficulty modifier in this system. context: invisible rogue and guard who may or may not have true sight.
	- [[Character 1]] sheet
		- Should include a money and items section to track spent income, purchases, current wealth, etc.
	- skills
		- taking new skills acts as an unlock. some actions are only possible if you actually have the relevant [[Skills]]. mandatory skills don't work for everything. 
		- Restrictions on when you can learn new skills. Need training, need downtime, etc.
		- define skills better. Possible Heuristic: skills allow you to do
		- add an example to [[Scope]]: fireball, fire magic, magic
	- Flavor
		- rename flavor to be countable (flavor is uncountable)
		- define flavor better. Heuristic: flavor represents thing you are or have
		- flavor cannot point to a specific [[Skills]]. If a flavor boils down to "+1 to a [[Skills]]" or "X [[Skills]] is easy for me" it isn't really flavor. Instead it should have many ups and downs and they should be situational.
		- Define more flavor systems than just money and items. What does it mean to be a species? What does it mean to have knowledge? What does reputation mean? Inherent spiritual, mental or physical attributes?
	- Combat
		- What the heck do defences look like these days?
		- round based conflict using action economy. series of opposed checks. synchronous as opposed to async.
		- damage
			- probably need a more generic attack modifiers list. also something that will work in mental or [[Social]] combat. I.e. Making an attack hard to evade is difficulty hard. Other mods include multitarget, lethal, feint, etc.
			- [[Scandals]] and damage system as currently imagined (physical; adapt for mental/[[Social]]. Spiritual [[Scandals]] tracks morality)
			- [[Body]] is a [[Character 1]]’s capacity to receive wounds (flavor) before going unconscious.
			- [[Storyteller]] represents characters as weak/vulnerable/bloody once they have [[Body]]-1 wounds.
			- some flavor can be bigger maybe? Mortal wounds?
			- characters with wounds equal to [[Body]] are incapacitated. [[Storyteller]] discretion as to what happens to them
			- characters with more wounds than [[Body]] die
	- [[Character 1]] Creation
		- at [[Skills]]/flavor creation, discuss power level as a limiting factor. it should be a consideration at the least.
		- at [[Skills]]/flavor creation, discuss the typical use case and difficulty.
		- Make sure [[Character 1]] creation, the “[[Character 1]]” section (if it exists), and the [[Character 1]] sheet (which I’m pretty sure doesn’t yet) all match up. Think about how I might make it so I only have to make updates to what a [[Character 1]] is in one place. (perhaps split systems and definitions like I did in [[Sark Douls]])
	- [[Sequoia (grapes)]]
		- Update store using the one found in Money and Items
		- The example [[Setting]] doc should define its own currency. I think it does. [[Sequoia (grapes)]] uses amber and aether to my knowledge.
	- [[Setting]]
		- Should I include system switches as part of the settings doc? (morality, money, fatigue, bulk, etc)
		- The [[Setting]] should define the currency

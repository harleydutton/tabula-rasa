 **Thoughts**
  - distributed storytelling. No storyteller, players create parts of a story and combine them ad libs style.
  - do I need a fatigue system?
  - do i need a bulk system?
  - requirements: experienced storyteller, players acting in good faith, 
  - round based conflict using action economy. series of opposed checks. synchronous as opposed to async. 
- **Hidden Information**
  - rename unsuspicious to oblivious
  - rename undetected to hidden
  - say somewhere that moving in stealth requires stealth rolls
  - I should make it clear that undetectable is not a state but rather a difficulty modifier in this system. context: invisible rogue and guard who may or may not have true sight.
- **skills?**
  - On the subject of ordering, all actions must be able to be reacted to. Do they though? Shooting?
  - taking new skills acts as an unlock. some actions are only possible if you actually have the relevant skill. mandatory skills don't work for everything.
- **combat**
  - actions
    - In addition all reactions occur after the action that caused them.
    - add running to actions (by converting a major to a move)
    - define more free actions. possibly convert some to minor actions
    - consider renaming move action minor action and defining some minor actions
    - extended (multiple turn) actions?
  - damage
    - characters cannot deal flavor amounting to instant death to anyone except mooks. 
    - does the attacking section need subsections?
    - characters can deal "dying" at typical difficulty of hard. 
    - Stripping defences is normal difficulty. 
    - Making an attack hard to evade is difficulty hard. 
    - after defences are stripped dealing dying/death can be done at normal difficulty.
    - Anyway, I suppose I should give some suggestions on how to create compelling puzzle bosses much the same way I give suggestions on how to create skills in the player section. Zelda bosses are good sources of inspiration and I recently saw an episode of critical role with ghosts who had their souls in breakable jars around the room.
- **influence**
  - try to combine mental and social influence.
- **setting**
  - add an example image/table for the store
  - add an example image for a whole setting doc
- **Character Creation**
  - reduce the "character creation" section and add sections to "character" (really just move them and refine both) (at this point just double check that character has definitions for everything it needs to have defs for.)
  - flavor cannot point to a specific skill. If a flavor boils down to "+1 to a skill" or "X skill is easy for me" it isn't really flavor. Instead it should have many ups and downs and they should be situational.
  - at skill/flavor creation, discuss power level as a limiting factor. it should be a consideration at the least.
  - at skill/flavor creation, discuss the typical use case and difficulty.
  - add an example to scope: fireball, fire magic, magic
  - the character and character creations settings are largely redundant. make them different or remove one.
    - maybe to complement "systems" have another top level section called "definitions". split the parts out of character and setting but still include character and setting and have them reference the smaller sections now. To some degree this is a bad idea because it implies that I should move the things I have defined in each subsection into it and that is crappy organization.
 - make sure CC, the sheet, and character match. Right now the sheet has "concept" and CC has "aesthetic description" and these are different.
- **Sequoia**
  - fix formatting
- **feedback**
  - which terms need to go in the glossary. does the glossary need to exist?
  - where do we need example images, charts, or descriptions?
  - define skills better. Heuristic: skills allow you to *do*
  - rename flavor to be countable (flavor is uncountable)
  - define flavor better. Heuristic: flavor represents thing you *are* or *have*
- **formatting**
  - format things using legend
  - put headings in title case
  - hyperlink the first reference to a section in every section
- **polish**
  - make the voice consistent ie. always speak to player
  - link things
  - add grammar check plugin (or just run a grammar check?)
  - make the images non-shit
  - export as PDF

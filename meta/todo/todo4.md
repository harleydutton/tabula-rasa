- Character Creation
    
    - reduce the "character creation" section and add sections to "character" (really just move them and refine both) (at this point just double check that character has definitions for everything it needs to have defs for.)
        
    - flavor cannot point to a specific skill. If a flavor boils down to "+1 to a skill" or "X skill is easy for me" it isn't really flavor. Instead it should have many ups and downs and they should be situational.
        
    - at skill/flavor creation, discuss power level as a limiting factor. it should be a consideration at the least.
        
    - at skill/flavor creation, discuss the typical use case and difficulty.
        
    - add an example to scope: fireball, fire magic, magic
        
- feedback
    
    - which terms need to go in the glossary. does the glossary need to exist?
        
    - where do we need example images, charts, or descriptions?
        
    - define skills better. Heuristic: skills allow you to _do_
        
    - define flavor better. Heuristic: flavor represents thing you _are_ or _have_
        
- formatting
    
    - format things using legend
        
    - put headings in title case
        
    - hyperlink the first reference to a section in every section
        
- polish
    
    - make the voice consistent ie. always speak to player
        
    - link things

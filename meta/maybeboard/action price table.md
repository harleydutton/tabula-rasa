this appears to deal with mana and stamina points, likely in addition to health.

### action price table
previously I thought this was a good idea. now i think keeping track of 4 stats during combat in addition to the other shit is insane.
If the timing of an action matters initiative should be rolled.
An action is the same thing as 5 initiative in a combat or a chase.
If the timing doesnt matter disregard the action costs.
Resting costs an action but the character regains 2 SP.
Walking and footwork are free.
Acrobatics or running costs an action and an SP.
Attacking costs an action and an SP.
Dodging or blocking costs an action and an SP.
Counter-attacking costs an action and an SP.
Using magic costs an action and an MP.
Attempting to hide costs an action.
Social interactions cost an action and an MP if they are magic.

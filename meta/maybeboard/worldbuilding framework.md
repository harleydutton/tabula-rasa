[[worldbuilding interface]]

tabula rasa doesn't *need* to have an included worldbuilding framework because [[Setting]] doesn't need all those parts. the storyteller book might benefit from it. include a worldbuilding framework like GRAPES, HERMETICS, that compass thingy, or the IRL anthropological backtracing of religions.

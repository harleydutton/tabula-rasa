Notably, I classify “lying” as an information hiding skill, similar to “sneaking”, rather than as a persuasion skill... because that's what it is.
lying: **first off you can't detect lying.**
If lying were an information hiding skill, mechanically, it would need to be detectable. Does that make it a persuasion skill?

### Armor
Armor should subtract from damage dealt
previously i had the idea that armor would contribute an integer value to an armor score for each piece of armor. (+3 helmet, +2 leather breeches, +7 chestplate, +5 shield = 17 armor score)
there are some problems with armor. first it can have more than one stat and they aren't related. there is hardness which determines what kind of attacks it will stop (soak). there is coverage which determines what percentage of your body it covers and this + dex might create a target number for to-hit checks against the character. lastly there is encumberance which can be positively or negatively affected by armor (normal plate, mithril-light-as-a-feather-BS-armor, and mjolnir power armor that actually makes the user stronger)
furthermore the AC thing isn't a particularly good metric for avoiding explosions but the encumberance value is as far as making checks goes. furthermore the encumberance value could have different effects on stealth and athletics/acrobatics checks. I really don't think it is worth statting all this shit out.

[[consider]] having defences be an attribute with exponential price scaling, some effect on incoming attacks:
- reduce damage; can't, damage is get flavor or don't
- chance to avoid damage: this is dodging
- I don't want an armor stat for every [[big Health]]
- **could roll "defences" to reduce attacker MOS**
- it could be an additional health pool for all 4 attributes? this doesn't really make sense.

The previous thought for armor and weapons, was that they would collectively modify the subjective difficulty of the attack roll. Attacking someone in plate armor with a sword would be pretty standard, possibly hard, attacking an armored knight with a lightsaber would be easy. This would also influence the wounds given.

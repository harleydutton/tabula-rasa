This is an idea for [[Setting Creation]] where the storyteller tells a program what kind of game they want to play and [[sections/setting/definition/Feature Flags|Feature Flags]] are messed with to promote that experience and a version of the rules is created via a statically hosted site that has that version of the rules. This would make feature flags and multiple systems a purely storyteller-facing concept and insulate players from sections they don't need that are confusing.

Decide:
- The storyteller can introduce the event die whenever they want.
- Roll the event die with every check

Basically when a check is rolled and additional d6 is rolled. If this d6 comes up 1 something bad happens and if it comes up 6 something good happen.

it's probably easiest to just have the storyteller roll the event die.

effectively speaking, this makes [[Crit success and fail]]'s independent of everything else in the check.

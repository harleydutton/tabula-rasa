 Entering a chase or combat from partial stealth grants 5 bonus initiative.
Attempting to enter stealth from a chase or combat costs an action, a stealth check, and somewhere to hide.
To stay hidden whilst doing something that could potentially reveal his or her location a character should roll additional stealth checks.

I feel like tiers of alarmedness might help regarding stealth. t0 alarm is thinking everything is fine. t1 alarm is thinking that, was weird. t2 alarm is knowing there are dudes. t3 alarm is seeing the dudes.

the result of t3 and t2 is the same, sound the alarm.
the result of t0 and t1 is the same, be on watch for dudes.

these are the intermediary states for the hider and seeker:
h: hidden and discovered
s: suspicious and alarmed

These are the terminal states for the hider and seeker:
s: oblivious and alarmed
h: hidden and caught

These musing's are prioritizing realism more than they probably should. I think I need to make sure the system plays fast, whatever it is as per [[Abstractions Over Realism]]

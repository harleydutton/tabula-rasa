The directory structure I am using is visible to users when presented using quartz on github pages. For this reason they should be formatted and presented nicely i.e. in title case. Go through all directories and make sure they are in title case.

This is already going to happen to 90% of things because of [[Notes at Same Level as Directories of the Same Name]]. [[Maintainable]] or something.

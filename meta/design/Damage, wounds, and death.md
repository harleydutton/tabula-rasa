### Damage, Wounds, and Death
In the current moment i vote for either perma-death or no relevant hitpoints.
damage is dealt as flavor. no bookkeeping for hitpoints!!!
if damage uses dice it should use a maximum of 2d6.
A "wound" is bad flavor gotten through combat from taking damage. Wounds give a -1 to all checks due to pain and possibly disability.
At one point I was keen on the idea that wounds and damage could be exchanged but the implementation requires me to make a bunch of charts with exchange rates and by it's nature it cannot be comprehensive. I think including this as an option with the DEALS feature might work though.
If you are using "wounds" to track damage then a character goes down when they have enough wounds that they cannot effectively participate in combat. A character dies when it would make sense for them to die. (decapitated, heart ripped out, stabbed 20 times, bleeding out for three days, when finished off by other characters while knocked out.)
If i am using hitpoints then 0 means dead, full stop, no death saves here.

[[consider]] a system I heard about recently, I think for savage worlds. The basic premise is that when you take physical damage you get some quantity of pain, shock and blood loss.
- shock gives you an immediate, temporary, and short lived disadvantage to your rolls.
- pain gives you a slightly delayed, somewhat lasting disadvantage to your rolls
- blood loss will eventually kill you in some fashion

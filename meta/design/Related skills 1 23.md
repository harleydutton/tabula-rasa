if you are good with a poleaxe/polehammer it stands to reason you wouldn't suck with a spear or some other polearm. that being said if your skill is named "polehammering" or some this it wont work with a spear. i think there are a few reasonable solutions.
1. the character takes a new skill at level one.
2. the character takes a new skill at half the level of the old skill.
3. the character renames the skill with DM permission
4. the character can make checks as though they had the new skill with half the old skill's level

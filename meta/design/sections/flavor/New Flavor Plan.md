I think I want to split flavor up into a couple sections:
- [[Items]] handles things you have
	- money, weapons, armor, tools, consumables, and the like
- [[Status|Statuses]] handle things affecting you
	- [[Wounds]], [[Curses]], [[Malaise|Malaises]], and [[Reputation|Reputations]]
	- stun, grappled, prone, wet, drunk, poisoned, and the like
- [[Descriptors]] describe things you are
	- wizard, vampire, robot, orc, guardsman, and the like

I think I want to split flavor up into a couple sections:
- [[Items]] handles things you have
	- money, weapons, armor, tools, consumables, and the like
- [[Statuses|Statuses]] handle things affecting you
	- [[Wounds]], [[Curses]], [[Malaise|Malaises]], and [[Reputation|Reputations]]
	- stun, grappled, prone, wet, drunk, poisoned, and the like
- [[Backgrounds]] describe things you are (and things you know?)
	- wizard, vampire, robot, orc, guardsman, and the like
	- common, elvish, the name of the wind

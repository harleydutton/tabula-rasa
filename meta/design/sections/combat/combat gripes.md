- Combat
	- What the heck do defences look like these days?
	- round based conflict using action economy. series of opposed checks. synchronous as opposed to async.
	- damage
	- probably need a more generic attack modifiers list. also something that will work in mental or [[Presence]] combat. I.e. Making an attack hard to evade is difficulty hard. Other mods include multitarget, lethal, feint, etc.
	- [[big Health]] and damage system as currently imagined (physical; adapt for mental/[[Presence]]. Spiritual [[big Health]] tracks morality)
	- [[Body]] is a [[Character 1]]â€™s capacity to receive wounds (flavor) before going unconscious.
	- [[Storyteller]] represents characters as weak/vulnerable/bloody once they have [[Body]]-1 wounds.
	- some flavor can be bigger maybe? Mortal wounds?
	- characters with wounds equal to [[Body]] are incapacitated. [[Storyteller]] discretion as to what happens to them
	- characters with more wounds than [[Body]] die
	- characters cannot deal flavor amounting to instant death to anyone except mooks. 
	- does the attacking section need subsections?
	- characters can deal "dying" at typical difficulty of hard. 
	- Stripping defences is normal difficulty. 
	- Making an attack hard to evade is difficulty hard. 
	- after defences are stripped dealing dying/death can be done at normal difficulty.
	- Anyway, I suppose I should give some suggestions on how to create compelling puzzle bosses much the same way I give suggestions on how to create skills in the player section. Zelda bosses are good sources of inspiration and I recently saw an episode of critical role with ghosts who had their souls in breakable jars around the room.

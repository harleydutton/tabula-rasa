Because it affects a number of systems I think it might be a good idea to put in checks that "the last action to be rolled as a success decides what happens" or something similar. This is in the interest of avoiding opposed rolls

- reactions beat actions
- resistance beats persuasion
- seeing beats stealth.

- this hits on [[Opposed Check]]s and [[Reaction]]s
- something like this might still work but I think i'm going to be using opposed rolls at least some of the time so I might have to reject this.
- I think better wording would be, you can use a reaction to [[Opposed Check|Oppose a Check]].

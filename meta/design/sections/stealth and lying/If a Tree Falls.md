If a tree falls in the forest does it make a noise? Only if there is someone there to hear it. If you fail a stealth check, and no guards detect it, you aren't detected. Failing a stealth check just puts the ball in the guard's court. Then the guard must make a check to see if they detect you. Effectively this is a system of opposed checks for stealth that are only triggered when one side fails to sneak properly.

this might say something about opposed checks. Are they free for the opposition? do they require a reaction in a timed scenario? this bears thinking about.

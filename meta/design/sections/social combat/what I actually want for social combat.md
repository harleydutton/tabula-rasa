social health
- social damage is super localized
	- leaving the area makes the damage not count against your total
	- doing stuff to fix your bad rep can fix it
	- time *can* fix bad rep
		- can be done on downtime
		- event die
			- 6 clears up bad rep
			- 5-2 group forgets, individual remembers
			- 1 group remembers too
			- does this healing system work for other health systems?
		- check
			- what check though? social? something time related?
			- perfect success clears up bad rep
			- partial success grudge by individual
			- failure still have bad rep with group

[[Unplayable]]
- what does being reduced to 0 or -1 social hp mean?
	- it is made clear you should stop. this is a [[Push Your Luck]] mechanic I guess.
	- -1 is [[Cascading Problems]], run out of town, jail, assassins, execution, character should be unplayable (soon)

That was me realizing I don't actually want most of the stuff outlined in [[design goals for social combat]] because I don't want to add dice to roleplaying so much as I want a GTA wanted meter for when players are acting like jackasses and need to experience consequences.

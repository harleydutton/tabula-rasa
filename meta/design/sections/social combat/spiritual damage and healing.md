spiritual health:
- spiritual damage is morality
	- committing sins cause damage
		- players need to define their moralities
	- can be adversarially damaged. a witch could curse you to be haunted or some shit.
- spiritual healing can be done in a few ways
	- you must try to undo the thing
	- you must sacrifice something
	- you have to figure out how to talk to your higher power and get a pardon
- consequences
	- spooky shit and warnings at 0, maybe mental or physical chip damage
	- [[Cascading Problems]] leading to death or crazyness via the supernatural. the character should be unplayable (soon) at -1

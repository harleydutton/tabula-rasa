- social conflict should not be resolved in one interaction
- there should be lots of back and forth
- it should still be quick (it shouldn't NEED the timing system)
- i think the most relevant part of this is probably social HP i.e. determining when someone must give up their position
- takeaway: figure out timing, figure out social HP
- no timing system because it damages the natural flow of a conversation even more

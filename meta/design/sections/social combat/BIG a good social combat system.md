- social conflict should not be resolved in one interaction
- there should be lots of back and forth
- it should still be quick (it shouldn't NEED the timing system)
- i think the most relevant part of this is probably social HP i.e. determining when someone must give up their position
- takeaway: figure out timing, figure out social HP
- no timing system because it damages the natural flow of a conversation even more

perhaps, social health is hits you have taken to your reputation in an engagement. if you push harder than you should you start collecting wounds sort of thing. breaking social decorum is the main one.

social health:
- but what about persuasion/mind control?
	- posessing/convincing should be a simple opposed roll I think
- social damage is super localized
	- leaving the area makes the damage not count against your total
	- doing stuff to fix your bad rep can fix it
	- time *can* fix bad rep
		- can be done on downtime
		- event die
			- 6 clears up bad rep
			- 5-2 group forgets, individual remembers
			- 1 group remembers too
			- does this healing system work for other health systems?
		- check
			- what check though? social? something time related?
			- perfect success clears up bad rep
			- partial success grudge by individual
			- failure still have bad rep with group
- what does being reduced to 0 or -1 social hp mean?
	- it is made clear you should stop. this is a [[Push Your Luck]] mechanic I guess.
	- -1 is [[Cascading Problems]], run out of town, jail, assassins, execution, character should be unplayable (soon)

 spiritual health:
- spiritual damage is morality
	- committing sins cause damage
		- players need to define their moralities
	- can be adversarially damaged. a witch could curse you to be haunted or some shit.
- spiritual healing can be done in a few ways
	- you must try to undo the thing
	- you must sacrifice something
	- you have to figure out how to talk to your higher power and get a pardon
- consequences
	- spooky shit and warnings at 0, maybe mental or physical chip damage
	- [[Cascading Problems]] leading to death or crazyness via the supernatural. the character should be unplayable (soon) at -1

- Sections to add
	- Fatigue system--necessary?
	- Bulk system--necessary?
	- Morality system
	- [[Storyteller]] v [[Player]] v [[Character 1]] v npc section
	- [[Storyteller]] discretion
	- Attributes section
	- Assisted checks
	- Actions
	    - In addition all reactions occur after the action that caused them.
	    - add running to actions (by converting a major to a move)
	    - define more free actions. possibly convert some to minor actions
	    - consider renaming move action minor action and defining some minor actions
	    - extended (multiple turn) actions?
		- In addition all reactions occur after the action that caused them.
		- Big actions can be converted to littler actions (attack -> move)
		- Timing
			- Subsections: Downtime, Conflict, and normal adventuring time/storytelling time. usually “scenes” will be my descriptive unit here.
- Section specific gripes
	- Timing
		- Define actions in the timing section. All of them. main/major action, reaction, minor, free, move, held action, extended action, offhand, mental, etc. see existing combat section/todo
		-   On the subject of ordering, all actions must be able to be reacted to. Do they though? Shooting?
		- Big actions can be converted to littler actions (attack -> move)
		- In addition all reactions occur after the action that caused them.
	- Distance
		- rename battlefields to something less combat oriented
		- switch the distance and movement sections. make it clear in the distance section that the system does not determine weapon ranges or the like
		- is the map section in distance useful?
	- Hidden Information
		- rename unsuspicious to oblivious
		- rename undetected to hidden
		- say somewhere that moving in stealth requires stealth rolls
		- I should make it clear that undetectable is not a state but rather a difficulty modifier in this system. context: invisible rogue and guard who may or may not have true sight.
	- [[Character 1]] sheet
		- Should include a money and items section to track spent income, purchases, current wealth, etc.
	- skills
		- taking new skills acts as an unlock. some actions are only possible if you actually have the relevant [[Skill]]. mandatory skills don't work for everything. ([[problems]] this just means I need to define skills and knowledge flavor better lol) 
		- Restrictions on when you can learn new skills. Need training, need downtime, etc.
		- define skills better. Possible Heuristic: skills allow you to do
		- add an example to [[Scope]]: fireball, fire magic, magic
	- Flavor
		- rename flavor to be countable (flavor is uncountable)
		- define flavor better. Heuristic: flavor represents thing you are or have
		- flavor cannot point to a specific [[Skill]]. If a flavor boils down to "+1 to a [[Skill]]" or "X [[Skill]] is easy for me" it isn't really flavor. Instead it should have many ups and downs and they should be situational.
		- Define more flavor systems than just money and items. What does it mean to be a species? What does it mean to have knowledge? What does reputation mean? Inherent spiritual, mental or physical attributes?
	- **influence**
		- try to combine mental and social influence.
	- Combat
		- What the heck do defences look like these days?
		- round based conflict using action economy. series of opposed checks. synchronous as opposed to async.
		- damage
			- probably need a more generic attack modifiers list. also something that will work in mental or [[Social]] combat. I.e. Making an attack hard to evade is difficulty hard. Other mods include multitarget, lethal, feint, etc.
			- [[big Health]] and damage system as currently imagined (physical; adapt for mental/[[Social]]. Spiritual [[big Health]] tracks morality)
			- [[Body]] is a [[Character 1]]’s capacity to receive wounds (flavor) before going unconscious.
			- [[Storyteller]] represents characters as weak/vulnerable/bloody once they have [[Body]]-1 wounds.
			- some flavor can be bigger maybe? Mortal wounds?
			- characters with wounds equal to [[Body]] are incapacitated. [[Storyteller]] discretion as to what happens to them
			- characters with more wounds than [[Body]] die
			- characters cannot deal flavor amounting to instant death to anyone except mooks. 
			- does the attacking section need subsections?
			- characters can deal "dying" at typical difficulty of hard. 
			- Stripping defences is normal difficulty. 
			- Making an attack hard to evade is difficulty hard. 
			- after defences are stripped dealing dying/death can be done at normal difficulty.
			- Anyway, I suppose I should give some suggestions on how to create compelling puzzle bosses much the same way I give suggestions on how to create skills in the player section. Zelda bosses are good sources of inspiration and I recently saw an episode of critical role with ghosts who had their souls in breakable jars around the room.
	- [[Character 1]] Creation
		- at [[Skill]]/flavor creation, discuss power level as a limiting factor. it should be a consideration at the least.
		- at [[Skill]]/flavor creation, discuss the typical use case and difficulty.
		- Make sure [[Character 1]] creation, the “[[Character 1]]” section (if it exists), and the [[Character 1]] sheet (which I’m pretty sure doesn’t yet) all match up. Think about how I might make it so I only have to make updates to what a [[Character 1]] is in one place. (perhaps split systems and definitions like I did in [[Sark Douls]])
		- the character and character creations settings are largely redundant. make them different or remove one.
		- reduce the "character creation" section and add sections to "character" (really just move them and refine both) (at this point just double check that character has definitions for everything it needs to have defs for.)
		- make sure CC, the sheet, and character match. Right now the sheet has "concept" and CC has "aesthetic description" and these are different.
		  - flavor cannot point to a specific skill. If a flavor boils down to "+1 to a skill" or "X skill is easy for me" it isn't really flavor. Instead it should have many ups and downs and they should be situational.
		  - at skill/flavor creation, discuss power level as a limiting factor. it should be a consideration at the least.
		  - at skill/flavor creation, discuss the typical use case and difficulty.
		  - add an example to scope: fireball, fire magic, magic
		  - the character and character creations settings are largely redundant. make them different or remove one.
			- maybe to complement "systems" have another top level section called "definitions". split the parts out of character and setting but still include character and setting and have them reference the smaller sections now. To some degree this is a bad idea because it implies that I should move the things I have defined in each subsection into it and that is crappy organization.
	- [[Sequoia]]
		- Update store using the one found in Money and Items
		- The example [[Setting]] doc should define its own currency. I think it does. [[Sequoia]] uses amber and aether to my knowledge.
	- [[Setting]]
		- Should I include system switches as part of the settings doc? (morality, money, fatigue, bulk, etc)
		- The [[Setting]] should define the currency
		- add an example image/table for the store
		- add an example image for a whole setting doc
- **polish**
	  - make the voice consistent ie. always speak to player
	  - link things
	  - add grammar check plugin (or just run a grammar check?)
	  - make the images non-shit
	  - export as PDF
  - **formatting**
	  - format things using legend
	  - put headings in title case
	  - hyperlink the first reference to a section in every section
- **feedback**
	- which terms need to go in the glossary. does the glossary need to exist?
	- where do we need example images, charts, or descriptions?
	- define skills better. Heuristic: skills allow you to *do*
	- rename flavor to be countable (flavor is uncountable)
	- define flavor better. Heuristic: flavor represents thing you *are* or *have*
-  **Thoughts**
	- distributed storytelling. No storyteller, players create parts of a story and combine them ad libs style.
	- requirements: experienced storyteller, players acting in good faith,

I want this game to have a low barrier to entry. I want players to be able to play this game with almost no buy-in and no prior knowledge. Ideally the only thing they should need is pen, paper, and dice.
- readable on a phone
- no expensive or difficult to acquire accessories required
- players shouldn't need to have a TTRPG background to play this game

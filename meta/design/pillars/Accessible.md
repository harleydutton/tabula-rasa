I want this game to have a low barrier to entry. I want players to be able to play this game with almost no buy-in and no prior knowledge. Ideally the only thing they should need is pen, paper, and dice. This means:
- readable
- no expensive things required
- no homework (doing a bunch of work outside of sessions) necessary for anyone

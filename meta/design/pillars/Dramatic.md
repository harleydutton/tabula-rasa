I would like these rules to promote--or at the very least not impede--drama.
- encourages roleplaying
- promotes bonds between PCs
- encourages storyteller to increase tension
- keeps the story on the rails

I'm not sure all of these things are "drama" specifically but I think these are the things I want. Rename the pillar, don't change the rubric.

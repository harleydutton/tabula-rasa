What I know of Hillfolk's group character creation worked super well when we did it in the Death In Space campaign. There was a bunch of drama and all the characters were super engaging and there were lots of interesting moments. Basically, it goes:

1. going clockwise, define a character concept and name
2. going counterclockwise, each player defines a relationship between their character and one other
3. going clockwise, define something your character wants from another character
	- they choose a reason they don't want to give you that
4. repeat the middle steps 2 and 3 until satisfied

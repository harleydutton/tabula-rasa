Death in Space has a principles page: This was a phenomenally useful page when I was learning the system. It described some overriding ways in which the world was meant to be represented. One of them was that wireless communication was no longer possible, despite it being a game set in space. Things like this seem like they will be a useful part of a world description for GM's and players alike.

ethan an i were talking about permanent statuses like losing an arm being converted to hooks. I think this should happen at downtime, it should not happen automatically i.e. there should be some new content negotiation. ethan thinks the choice to gain a new corrupted mod should be given to only the player with the permanent status such that they feel special.

maybe this could be part of [[Rest]] or [[Narrated Scene]]:
- heal all temporary [[Negative Statuses]] that will go away on their own
- use permanent statuses to balance new [[Background|Backgrounds]]
- get [[Sections/Character/Experience]] for unbalanced permanent statuses
- remove permanent statuses from counting against [[Catch-All Skills]] and put them with backgrounds in both cases

[[No More Hooks or Boons]]. these would be the crappy half of a background.

The storyteller should have minimal power in this process. Players should get mangling wounds sometimes and it should be an actual rule, not something requiring much if any storyteller judgment.

this is very similar to [[Corrupted Mods]]. I think the concept of "long rest" or downtime is a reasonable time to add these to a character.

Death and space does thing thing that I really like for managing [[Experience]]. At the end of every session players get 1 experience for each of these questions they answer yes to:
- did you repair something?
- did you deliver on a dangerous contract?
- did you use at least one void point?
- did you discover a new and potentially dangerous place?
- did you gain a new enemy?
- did you find someone new that you can trust?
- did you contribute with something especially memorable?

I think this is a really good way to make experience fair and encourage players to engage with the [[World]]. To that end, I think this should probably be a section in "scalings" ([[Linear Experience Costs]] and [[Quadratic Experience Costs]]) and that section should probably be renamed to "experience". I will probably move [[Experience]] there too because it makes more sense to have it there than in "character". I will need a section in [[Filling out a World]] to help the [[Storyteller]] make world specific questions.

This is already half done. [[Rubric]] and [[Rubric]] already exist. I guess I just need to move this stuff into the same section to complete this task.

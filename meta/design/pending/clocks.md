I think apocalypse uses clocks to represent progress on extended actions. I might steal this system ~~and have [[Downtime]] be the trigger to tick them up.~~
This system is used by blades in the dark.

clocks are a circle with pie-slice lines through them creating some multiple of two number of pie slices. these are to represent progress of some kind that can be tracked. BITD suggests putting them on index cards in the middle of the table. there are multiple kinds of clock:
- normal (danger, progress): single clock. when it fills something happens
- contested (race, pass/fail): two clocks, both stop counting when one completes and something happens based on the completed clock
- sequential (armor -> health): only when the first clock completes can you start working on the second. when the second completes, something happens

I would like to avoid contested rolls in combat. Similarly, I would like to avoid private target numbers and such. The point would be to speed up combat greatly.

this could be accomplished in a pirate borg fashion where it is assumed the player is rolling for everything. in this case enemies always succeed at whatever they are doing and players roll to try and contest it. the storyteller probably shouldn't be touching the dice. opposed rolls would be reserved for PVP stuff.

Another option I just thought of is to only make a check for the more difficult half of an opposed action. Dodging bullets and explosions, detecting an invisible guy, etc. and just assume the easier half happens. This doesn't work terribly well for PVP though.

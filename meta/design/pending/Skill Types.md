~~I'm working through the timing section right now and it talks about [[Defensive Action]] as an action type.~~ I think it might be worth having some overarching [[Skills|Skill]] types that each new skill created must fall into. New skills could maybe even be multiple types. Off the top of my head:
- proactive skill
- defensive skill
- movement skill
- crafting skill
- gathering skill
- communication skill
- magic skill

This might let me [[Balance by Codifying and Nerfing]] a couple of the more problematic ones.

This needs evaluated. moving to pending.

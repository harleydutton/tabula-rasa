things are not a part of their parts list


This is how things should be:
- folder structure
	- **world sheet**
	- world sheet/
		- part 1
		- part 2
		- part 3
	- world
	- so on

In many instances things are like this:
- folder structure
	- world sheet/
		- **world sheet**
		- part 1
		- part 2
		- part 3
	- world
	- so on

... is trying to enforce this against [[Maintainable]]? should I make this decision without enforcement to nudge me in the right direction if I'm stuck on it?

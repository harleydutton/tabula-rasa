ethan an i were talking about permanent statuses like losing an arm being converted to hooks. I think this should happen at downtime, it should not happen automatically i.e. there should be some new content negotiation. ethan thinks the choice to gain a new corrupted mod should be given to only the player with the permanent status such that they feel special.

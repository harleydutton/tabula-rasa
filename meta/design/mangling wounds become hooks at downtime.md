ethan an i were talking about permanent statuses like losing an arm being converted to hooks. I think this should happen at downtime, it should not happen automatically i.e. there should be some new content negotiation. ethan thinks the choice to gain a new corrupted mod should be given to only the player with the permanent status such that they feel special.

maybe this could be part of [[Rest]] or [[Downtime]]:
- heal all temporary [[Statuses]] that will go away on their own
- use permanent statuses to balance new [[Background|Backgrounds]]
- get [[Experience]] for unbalanced permanent statuses
- remove permanent statuses from counting against [[Catch-All Skills]] and put them with backgrounds in both cases

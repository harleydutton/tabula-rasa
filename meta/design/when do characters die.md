DEATH BY FLAVOR: When does a character die? 
(when they gain a flavor that would kill them. use DTMS checks) When they have a certain number of bad flavors? (no, not by number) Who determines what flavor can be added to a character? (called shots, the player) Perhaps we should just have health? (no) How do you determine when a character has accumulated enough flavor that they are unconscious or dead? (DTMS check) 

This can probably be solved by saying the difficulty for giving immediately lethal flavor will usually be high against non-mooks unless you have silver bullets. Unconscious, sleeping, incapacitated, downed, etc. characters can be killed outright. When a character achieves the downed status from wounds is based on a DTMS check I guess? Not having source material makes combat messy... When moving is non-trivial (on the trivial, easy, normal, hard, impossible subjective check difficulty scale) a character is downed? When attacking is impossible a character can be considered impotent/incapacitated and initiative can be dropped.

### alternative
implement a health system HEALTH SYSTEM: consider using attributes as HP pools. all attacks do one damage. players can ask the storyteller if a combatant is "vulnerable/weak". What this means is "is the combatant at 1 health in a relevant health pool?" Players can inflict wounds on this health pool if the enemy is not vulnerable/weak. Players can inflict "dying" on a combatant if they are weak. Combatants that drop to 0 in a health pool (have had dying/wound inflicted on them at 1 HP) are incapacitated. Players can inflict "dead" on a characters at 0 HP (dying) in a relevant pool. ########## I might also consider adding another keyword storytellers can use to indicate that players can inflict dead on combatants at 1 HP in a relevant attribute. if scale is meaningfully different the more powerful character can inflict dying upon the weaker character at any health level. perhaps characters can be "large" or equivalent by adding 3 or so to their base AD. Limiting factors can maybe be replaced with a scale chart that works for body, mind, spirit, and social.
- 2+ = alive and well
- 1 = weak; can have dying inflicted upon and maybe dead?
- 0 = dying/incapacitated; can have dead inflicted upon and might die if not saved
- -1 = real dead

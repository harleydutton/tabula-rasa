I'm moving away from the term "Character Points" which was previously the stuff used to create characters. 
1. Character Points abbreviates to 'CP' which is an unpleasant abbreviation. IYKYK.
2. [[Don't Reinvent the Wheel]]: This is just [[Sections/Character/Experience]] as most other games would define it.
3. I'm trying to avoid overloading the "character" string.

Using fewer game terms in [[Minimal]].

Games like D&D4E feel like you need to consult 5-10 tables of modifiers before you can make any check. This is slow, and feels bad. Presenting this as a [[Wiki not Book]] will give players a search bar to make it really easy to do look-ups. The aim of this decision is not to do no look-ups; it's to minimize them and make them easy.

This decision supports the pillars of being [[Accessible]] and [[Simple]].

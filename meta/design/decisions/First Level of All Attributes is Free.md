There is a notable difference between the [[Attribute|Attributes]] for [[Catch-All Skills]] and the others. [[Mind]], [[Body]], [[Spirit]], and [[Presence]] must begin at at least level 1 to guarantee that every [[Character]] can attempt any [[Checks|Check]]. On the other hand, 0 is a reasonable starting value for [[Wealth]] and [[Speed]].

It is only a 1 [[Experience]] difference, but in the interest of making the definition of "attributes" stronger, *all* attributes will be starting at level 1 rather than just those for [[Catch-All Skills]].

This decision supports the pillars of being [[Simple]] and [[Maintainable]].

There will be some number of catch-all Skills that allow any character to attempt any check. These skills will level differently i.e. via [[Quadratic Experience Costs]] and will have a minimum level of 1. These are currently called [[Attribute|Attributes]] and they are [[Mind]], [[Body]], [[Spirit]], and [[Presence]].

Partial stealth is being hidden relative to some characters but visible to others. "Sneaks" and "seekers" are scene code names for talking about [[Secret|Secrets]]

Partial stealth is a pain in the ass to manage and conflicts with the [[Avoid Overwhelming Bookkeeping]] design decision. As such, all "seekers" within a scene *can* but don't have to be aware of a caught character, because talking is a free action. This is mostly a decision for the storyteller for how much bookkeeping they want to do in the moment.

This decision supports the pillars of being [[Empowering]] and [[Simple]].

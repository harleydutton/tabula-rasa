Tabula doesn't have a dedicated perception stat because it doesn't need one and that doesn't make sense anyway. The storyteller should just tell players about information they need to have seen for plot reasons, and they should make them roll for information they don't strictly need. This is possible because while there is no dedicated stat for it, the [[Catch-All Skills]] have you covered. The storyteller just needs to be aware that they shouldn't make players roll for information unless they are okay with them not receiving that information--just give it to them.

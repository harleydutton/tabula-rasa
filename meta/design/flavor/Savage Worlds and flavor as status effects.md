a system I heard about recently, I think for savage worlds. The basic premise is that when you take physical damage you get some quantity of pain, shock and blood loss.
- shock gives you an immediate, temporary, and short lived disadvantage to your rolls.
- pain gives you a slightly delayed, somewhat lasting disadvantage to your rolls
- blood loss will eventually kill you in some fashion

Should I have a "Status Effects" system? This looks like it would be fairly necessary to implement a bunch of common things in combat like Stun, Grapple, Pain, Shock, etc.

would a status effect system be worth the cost? It will be more bookkeeping. Status effects usually aren't terribly fun.

I have been wanting to split Flavor up anyway. Flavor has always been things you are and things you have. We have a system (Wealth) for the things you have. I think traits/statuses is the other half I need to really flesh out flavor.

think about splitting flavor up into items, traits and statuses. fresh characters should have no statuses so their items and traits should account for the rest of the character points. (on character point forensics)

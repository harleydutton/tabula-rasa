Let me take a more constructive approach. I read this political newsletter, Tangle, and since it's published via email, you can write in as a reader - and I have, a few times, and Issac and I have chatted about a few topics. One of them was conspiracy theories. And one of the core things I said in response to his article was: "An outlandish claim requires a proportionally outlandish burden of proof." That evidence must be proportional to the scope of the conspiracy theory. So, in the pages where you're struggling with how to appropriately scope skills, that seems an effective self-regulation - finding a way to model proportional trade-offs. "I want to learn sailing". Okay, if you want that to be all kinds of sailing forever - knots, celestial navigation, etc - then you lose out on the ability to have free-form skills of another variety in the future. If we want to avoid a skill-slot system for something like this, then we could give guidelines to the Storyteller that they can either expect the trade-off to be offered with the skill proposal (e.g. i get to be an expert sailor because I don't know how to navigate on land and constantly get lost), or constrained to a smaller, more proportional scope later on (e.g. I know how to tie knots as part of my sailing.... but working with my hands put me in a situation where I never learned how to read?). And the guidelines Tabula publishes are on reaching that shared goal of _proportionality_ - as a proposal

I think at this point the second paragraph might be useful for [[Background]] creation. Trade-offs were not something that was previously in limits for skills but it makes sense for backgrounds.

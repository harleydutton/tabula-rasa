It (tabula) will discuss types of stories and provide tools for running/making a variety of them. --the intro

---

by tools I mean things like a storyteller section that lays out a process for quickly brainstorming tables of things if you are playing a game that needs them. and other similar things that aren't tables. basically an "I can't give you what you need because I don't know what it is but I can teach you how to make it quickly" section

This would be supporting games like the social game or the roam, fight, trade loop game or the continental travel game.

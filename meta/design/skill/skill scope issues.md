### problems with previous iterations of "players are allowed to create their own skills"
tl;dr players could make skills that were vague and applied to every scenario and then max them.
- using incredibly broad skills that apply to every scenario. "social graces" applies to every social situation, provides little character depth, and makes it so a player can use the dice to walk all over the game.
an example tree of skill scope
> animal skills  
>> riding  
>>> horses  
>>> camels  
>>> elephants  
>> driving  
>>> oxen  
>>> mules and horses  
>>> dogs  
>> care  
>>> grooming  
>>> feeding  
>>> breeding  
>>> veterinary  
>>>> first aid  
>>>> diagnosis  
>>>> medicine  
>>>> surgery    
A character might know “knots” because they know the skill “sailing” and that’s fine even though the character is getting a lot of skills for free under the umbrella-skill of “sailing”. 
On the other hand I encouraged THIS at one point.
perhaps settings should include a list of default/common skills?
there is something of a goldilocks zone for skill scope. Magic is too broat, fireball is too narrow, but fire magic is just right.

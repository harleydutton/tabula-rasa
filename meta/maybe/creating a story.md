### creating a story
provide some kind of visual framework like a flowchart for creating episodic stories. scenes should have a few options as to how they can resolve most times.
an alternative method of creating the story is how blood in the snow does it. make sure each scene has a granter and a petitioner. (petitioner wants _something_ from granter). the scene can resolve however it does but it should start with these two elements. I think both were supposed to be PCs. i think the players and possibly the game "referee" are supposed to come up with scenes like this on the fly. this is from blood in the snow.

### star wars check system
The basic idea here is that a die is added to checks that represents a constantly shifting landscape. This means good or bad roleplaying events can occur when players roll checks in and out of combat.

at some point i liked the star wars RPG system of dice having successes and "good stuff" on them and failures and "bad stuff". this led to a system where you could have phyrric victories and defeats that weren't all bad.
Decide whether or not i want crit successes and/or crit failures.
possibly put crits and crit fails on a separate die to control the probability of such.
buy successes/failures and good/bad stuff with pips on the relevant dice.
should rolls always be opposed?
at some point i was in favor of constructing skill checks based on positive and negative dice. negative dice represented the difficulty of the task and the difficulties resulting from the situation. positive dice would represent the character's skill at the task and any advantages they had towards completing the task. when all the positive and negative dice are rolled successes cancel failures and negatives cancel failures.
very good/bad stuff always overrides the other good/bad in the typical opposed roll.
a check fails if there are fewer successes than failures on the dice. it seems like this system expects you to purchase successes, failures, good stuff, and bad stuff. it also seems like it requires far more than three identical 6ds. it seems like it wants d10s and specfic symbols on those dice.
excess successes and failures contribute to magnitude of success.
excess good stuff and bad stuff mean nothing in particular.
net good/bad stuff means a bunch of good/bad story things happen. this might be a little insane if it happens to often. the DM only has to resolve one good/bad stuff per check

These are actions that take more than one turn to complete. They can occur in [[Downtime]] and [[Combat]]. There should be a section in the [[Getting Started as a Storyteller]] for when to request these like for the [[Weird checks]].

To be fair, the number of successes should be determined ahead of time. This should probably be directly tied to [[meta/design/pending/clocks]] if I choose to implement them.

this section makes more sense as "these are clocks. they can handle extended actions" the section.

progress and extended actions aren't really a tabula specific thing. Furthermore these are usually unfun or anticlimactic. trash.

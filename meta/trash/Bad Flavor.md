Negative Flavor is usually acquired in two ways. The first way is usually through deals. Rather than asking for a piece of flavor that does something good and something bad a player might ask for a piece of flavor that is mostly bad and ask that it not cost them CP. If the storyteller agrees that this is bad flavor then you can take it for free. The second way characters usually get negative flavor is from combat. When one character lops off another character's hand with a sword that new `-1 hand` will need to be remembered unless that character ceases to matter. Flavor can handle arbitrary negative effects like wounds perfectly.

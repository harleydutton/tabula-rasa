If you have another character as a companion you should list them as flavor or make a character sheet for them. Any animal companions, demonic familiars, slaves, shipboard AI, or loyal friends should be either listed as flavor or have their own character sheet made or both. Whatever is most apt. Consult the deals section and the storyteller.

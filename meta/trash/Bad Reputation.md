What is it?
Bad Reputation is what it sounds like. mechanically it is [[Descriptors (remove)]], usually [[Damage]], sometimes [[Background]].

getting it:
- you get bad rep by being a naughty, naughty boy and getting caught by someone who cares.
	- you get other rep by getting noticed doing something noteworthy
- you can also you can also get reputation if someone spreads rumors about you.

healing:
- reputation can be localized so leaving town might make your bad rep cease to matter.
- time usually causes grudges to be forgotten. consult your [[Storyteller]] at downtime. options include:
	- guaranteed healing (the bad rep just goes away at downtime)
	- random healing that is independent of player stats ([[The Event Die]])
	- random healing that is dependent on player stats ([[Presence]] [[Checks|Check]])
	- bad rep goes down a stage (group|individual(s)|nobody)
	- you can try and patch things up by makeing reparations through RP, probably requiring Presence Checks
	- or any combination of the above

death:
if you have more bad reputation than [[Presence]] your character will become [[Death]] and you should probably make a new character.

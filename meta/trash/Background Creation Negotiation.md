Let me take a more constructive approach. I read this political newsletter, Tangle, and since it's published via email, you can write in as a reader - and I have, a few times, and Issac and I have chatted about a few topics. One of them was conspiracy theories. And one of the core things I said in response to his article was: "An outlandish claim requires a proportionally outlandish burden of proof." That evidence must be proportional to the scope of the conspiracy theory.

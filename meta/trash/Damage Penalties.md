there is no dice penalty on [[Checks]] when a [[Character]] has [[Damage]]. Statuses should be accounted for when the [[Storyteller]] sets the check [[Difficulty]] and otherwise they should be ignored.

I think a design decision to the tune of "I don't say when there isn't something" might make this whole thing a little simpler and more accessible. consider codifying that and rejecting this.

double checked the [[Difficulty]] section. this should be a non-issue. trash.

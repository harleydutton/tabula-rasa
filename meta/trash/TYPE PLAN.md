It feels like maybe I shouldn't have all four of:
- [[Background Creation Negotiation]]
- [[Item Creation and Pricing]]
~~- [[Skill Types]]~~
- [[Skill Creation]]

I think I should probably follow the backlinks and find out why these things exist. In general, I want people to arrive at this section and look at it's entrypoint [[New Content Negotiation (unlucky)]].

I probably should talk about content and it should happen in the [[Content]] note where I link to the ~~[[Descriptors]],~~ [[Skills|Skill]], [[Items|Item]], [[Background|Backgrounds]], 

---

might remove later but these are standardized now. I don't think they belong in content as there are things to talk about that are unique to each type. trash.

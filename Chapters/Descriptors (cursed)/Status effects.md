this is from the sark douls combat system. if it were combined with [[clocks]] it would be fairly simple to implement any status effect in any game.

---

Whenever you are dealt status damage you will accrue stacks of the status. You lose one point of status per second.

### Bleed

When you reach bleed 10 stacks your stacks are reset to 0 and you take half of your maximum health as unmitigatable damage.

### Poison

Once you reach 10 poison stacks, gain 10 poison stacks and you cannot gain poison until you reach 0 stacks. You take 1 poison damage per second.

### Chill

When you reach 10 chill stacks take 5 damage and reduce your stamina regeneration by 1 per second until you are no longer chilled.

### Curse

When you reach 10 curse points, curse is not removed with time, you die and your max health is halved until you are no longer cursed.

### Leech

Leech gives you one bleed stack per second until you come into contact with fire. The leech status is binary and does not have stacks.

### Stun

You cannot take actions. If you are stunned because you cast/attacked you do not regain stamina.

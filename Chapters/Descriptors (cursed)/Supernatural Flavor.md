Supernatural flavor is how one might represent being a priest to a specific god. Seriously just put down `priest of Khorn` to be that. Similarly if a character is `haunted`, `blessed`, or in a `demonic pact` just put those things down. That covers the social aspect of supernatural flavor. On the other hand a character could be `magically adept`, `unnaturally sweaty`, or `the chosen one`.

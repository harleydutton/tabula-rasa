This section will detail a system for long distance travel:
~~potential new terms: [[Rest]], fatigue~~
Desired outcome of this section is distance traveled per time
It will be necessary for the storyteller to set a typical travel speed.
It will be necessary for the storyteller to choose between grid or not.
Travel should also be kinda like downtime.
increase or decrease rest/fatigue?

this section should detail how you get from point a to point b in the world, what it costs, what you get, what happens along the way, and how fast this all happens.

so, traveling from point a to point b should take some number of days
one day per tile on the world map usually. 
what if a and b are adjacent? then you use hours as your timescale
what if they arent? you use days as your timescale

travel time, scale, cost, and representation should maybe handled in a separate section but [[Toolkit]] might be able to handle it.

Most of this stuff is like [[Default Delay]] and [[Tick Length]] in that it is just a [[Storyteller]] defined constant that could go on the [[World Sheet]]. It would need to be accompanied by a map but I'm going to put a section in [[Toolkit]] about making maps.

I think maybe the best place for this is in the world sheet...
moving it there for the moment.

taken from [[Spatial]]. should maybe be returned

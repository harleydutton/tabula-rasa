Downtime is time that is narrated or glossed over because the story is at a point of low tension. Sleep, travel and finishing a climactic moment are common reasons to enter downtime. Possible effects include:
- [[Wounds]] are assessed, becoming permanent or healing ([[Corrupted Mods]], [[mangling wounds become backgrounds at downtime]], [[big Health]])
- [[Need|Needs]] assessed, gaining or losing, hunger, thirst, fatigue, etc. based on if that need has been satisfied.
- [[Items]] and [[Money]] assessed, gaining or losing currency or materials based on [[Wealth]]
- New [[Skills]] can be learned
- making progress on long term projects

the effects of downtime are usually noted elsewhere:
- [[Rest]]
- [[Travel]]
- [[Wealth]]
- [[Need|Needs]]

possible notable exceptions:
- progress on long term projects like crafting
- learning new skills
- getting new backgrounds

because of all this, it might be better to have downtime live in the definitions chapter

To start a [[Combat]] two things need to happen. First, for each [[Character]] roll a [[Dice|Die]] add their [[Turn Delay]] to determine which [[Tick]] their first [[Turn]] is on. Second, the [[Storyteller]] should begin counting out the [[Current Tick]] starting from one. If a character enters a timed scene after it has started they roll 1d6 + turn delay + current tick to determine which tick their first turn is on.

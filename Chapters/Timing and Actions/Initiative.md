To start a [[Timed Scene]] two things need to happen. First, for each [[Character]] roll 1d6 + [[Turn Delay]] to determine which [[Tick]] their first [[Turn]] is on. Second, the [[Storyteller]] should begin counting the [[Current Tick]]. If a character enters a timed scene after it has started they roll 1d6 + turn delay + current tick to determine which tick their first turn is on.

Sneaks are simpler than guards. They only have two states: Hidden and not-hidden. Notably, not-hidden isn't "seen/caught", it just means that they could be as per [[If a Tree Falls]]

[[Sneak]]s always have one of the three following states. The first two are independent of [[Observer]]s:
- [[Hidden]]
- [[Obvious]]
- [[Detected]]

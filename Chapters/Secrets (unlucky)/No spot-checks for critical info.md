Tabula doesn't have a dedicated perception stat. this is for two reasons:

The first is that you should streamline the process for distributing information. If there are 5 people flipping a coin to see if they see the thing thay have a 1/32 chance to miss the thing and usually players have better odds than that so it's really just a waste of time.

the second is that 1/32nd of the time you shoot yourself in the foot if you are giving out critical info rather than optional info.

the correct solution here is to just give out critical info 100% of the time and have players roll for optional info. These rolls for optional info can usually be handled with domain knowledge from a skill or using an attribute.

am I trying to talk about spot checks, critical info, or tabula's lack of a perception stat? Do I want to do anything regarding passive perception?

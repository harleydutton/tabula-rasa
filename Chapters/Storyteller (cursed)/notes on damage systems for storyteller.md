so, there are four damage systems. players have limited control of their health pools. you largely get to control the types, permanence, severity, and frequency of damage.

- the physical damage pool ([[Body]]) is generic and mostly adds a sense of danger to combat
- the mental damage pool ([[Mind]]) is also pretty generic and doesn't have an explicit purpose right now
- the supernatural damage pool ([[Spirit]]) can be used as a morality system or to prevent red room bullshit or represent the wrath of the gods. it may be necessary to have players define/choose a moral/deific code they want to be held to.
- the social damage pool ([[Presence]]) can be used to prevent muder-hobo behavior or used as a [[GTA Wanted Meter]]

you can tell players when characters are bloody (even wounds and health) if you want them to be able to describe killshots

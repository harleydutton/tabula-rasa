Sometimes there are conflicts where multiple characters are competing for the same goal. In horse races, arm wrestling, poker games, and drinking contests multiple characters will be attempting to win but only one can. In all likelihood, multiple characters will pass a check to win any given contest. How do we deal with this situation? The answer is to calculate how much each character succeeded and compare those values.

Normally we only care if a check passes or fails, but in these instances we want to know by how much. When a check is rolled magnitude of success starts at 0 and increases by 1 for each six-sided die that equals or exceeds the target number ([difficulty](#_ogl1qn75g9xv)).

To resolve a contest of some kind each character involved should make a check, and their magnitudes of success should be ranked, highest to lowest. The highest result wins the contest. Ties can occur.

with two [[Character|Characters]] this is basically the same as [[Oppose]]. With 3 or more it becomes it's own thing. might be worth keeping around.

## from "contests"

Contests are where two or more characters are trying to be best at some action. The problem comes in that there is a good chance both characters will succeed and so we must use magnitude of success to determine the winner of the contest. You only need one success to pass a skill check. Any successes beyond one contribute to magnitude of success. The character with the highest magnitude of success wins the contest. When the magnitudes of success are tied there is a tie.

Racing, feats of strength, public debates, drinking contents, and gambling are all common contests.

Roundtable character creation is a form of group character creation that typically results in very good roleplaying.

To form a new group:
0. The storyteller should explain the call to adventure.
1. Each player picks a name and character concept.
2. Each player defines a relationship between their character and another PC with the fewest relationships.
3. Each player describes something their character wants from another PC whom the fewest things are wanted from.
	- To add dramatic tension, there should be a reason this want is not satisfied.
4. Each player explains why their character is pursuing the call to adventure.
5. Each player tells the storyteller a way their character can be motivated.

To add new characters to an existing group:
1. Follow steps 0 and 1 above.
2. An existing player and the new character's player perform steps 2 and 3 above.
3. The new character's player perform steps 4 and 5 above.

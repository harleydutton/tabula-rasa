## plot focused 

map out the things that are going to happen using the typical 3-act play as a guide: 
- Act I – Setup: Exposition, inciting incident, plot point one 
- Act II – Confrontation: Rising action, midpoint, plot point two 
- Act III – Resolution: Pre climax, climax, conclusion
## character focused
if you want a character focused game do the plot focused thing, then this:
1. have your players give you their character backstories/histories.
2. begin connecting elements of the backstories to plot points on a web.

when you need a random table jot down some entries and then ask a friend, the internet, or your table for some more entries. Write the ones down that fit what you are going for with this table and then assign it to one of these common table sizes. If you have too many values remove some or go up a table size. If you have too few values go down a table size or you can pad it with rerolls. For the curved tables you should move less common outcomes to the high and low ends of the table.

- character is attempting two non-trivial actions (checks) at the same time
	- in combat this consumes both [[Main Action]] and [[Supporting Action]]
	- action dependent on or simultaneously with another action
- try single check first
	- increased difficulty
	- switch to attribute
- nested check
	- difficulty of second check influenced by first check outcome
		- can make second check impossible
- composite check
	- each check maximum successes is 1
	- both checks contribute to a single outcome

probably this results in a difficulty modifier. this makes the most sense for something like a strength check and in that instance just adding all the dice together makes sense.

this might need to be different in combat and out of combat. it would be unwise to sacrifice a whole action for just a difficulty modifier.

assisted check options
- both attempt same check at once -- both roll, take higher [[Outcome]]
- work can be distributed perfectly -- both roll, determine outcome from cumulative successes
- action to help doesn't require check -- change [[Difficulty]]
- action to help requires check -- roll one, then roll the other with modified difficulty

It occurs rarely the work for some task a character is trying to accomplish with a [[Checks|Check]] can be shared perfectly such that doubling the workers halves the work. In cases like this roll multiple checks and add up the successes before determining a single outcome. Situations which do not qualify.


There are plenty of situations where multiple characters working on a task together could have different results

- multiple characters, same task
	- task is shared = successes add together
	- assisting with task = modify difficulty
	- outcome is shared = multiple check, take best/worst outcome
	- task is contested = compare [[Magnitude of Success]]
- one character, multiple or complicated actions
	- sequential actions = two checks, first affects difficulty of second
	- simultaneous actions =  two checks, simultaneously checks, max MoS = 1, successes contribute to 1 outcome 

|                 | success                | partial success | failure                     |
| --------------- | ---------------------- | --------------- | --------------------------- |
| success         | MOS, or double success | success         | success, maybe consequences |
| partial success | success                |                 |                             |
| failure         |                        |                 |                             |


probably this results in a difficulty modifier. this makes the most sense for something like a strength check and in that instance just adding all the dice together makes sense.

this might need to be different in combat and out of combat. it would be unwise to sacrifice a whole action for just a difficulty modifier.

assisted check options
- both attempt same check at once -- both roll, take higher [[Outcome]]
- work can be distributed perfectly -- both roll, determine outcome from cumulative successes
- action to help doesn't require check -- change [[Difficulty]]
- action to help requires check -- roll one, then roll the other with modified difficulty

extracting info to [[Nested and Composite Checks]]?no, they aren't the same

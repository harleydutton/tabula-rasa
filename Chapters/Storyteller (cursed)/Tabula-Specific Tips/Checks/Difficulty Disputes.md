As a storyteller, it can be tricky for set a [[Difficulty]] for checks on subjects you aren't familiar with--especially if those subjects don't exist--and this can cause malcontent among your players. Below are options for dealing with that problem.
- If the difficulty is based on something unknown to the players consider revealing it.
- Remind players that backgrounds, items, and circumstance affect difficulty while levels like skills and attributes do not.
- Ask if someone in your group is knowledgeable on the subject and heed their opinion.
- Call for your group to vote on the difficulty of the check with the understanding that you will break ties. Do not let players call for such votes.

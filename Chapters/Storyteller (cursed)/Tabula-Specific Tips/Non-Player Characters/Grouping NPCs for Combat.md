As a [[Storyteller]], you may wish to group similar enemies in combat to shorten the time their turns take. Here I outline the needed steps to accomplish this and their justifications:
1. Give each member of the group the same stats. They should have the same [[Speed]], [[Attribute|Attributes]] and [[Skills|Skills]]. Characters must be the same to be efficiently grouped.
2. Roll [[Initiative]] once and have every member of the group join combat  and act on the same [[Tick]]. If you were to group them but not have them act on the same tick you would need to constantly adjust their speed as the group lost members so you must place them all on the same tick. It can be wise to create multiple groups if too many are acting on the same turn.
3. Give the group a shared health pool equal to the number of members multiplied by the main attribute they will be using for [[Damage]]. Every time the group loses health equal to that main attribute one of it's members is incapacitated. Don't try to keep track of [[Damage]] on specific group members as the loss of speed will make this exercise pointless.
4. The group should have a number of [[Actions]] equal to it's active members. You should only need to track the [[Reaction|Reactions]] as the group should use all [[Main Action|Main Actions]] on it's turn.

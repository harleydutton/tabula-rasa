I don't trust anyone to properly record how much [[Experience]] they have spent or have remaining. Because of that, I designed the leveling system for [[index|Tabula Rasa]] such you can determine how much experience has been spent on a character by tallying up how much experience you would have to spend to recreate them.

go through meta/ for other instances where I have explicitly designed the system to help/enable storytellers to solve problems like this and point them out.

When to use [[The Event Die]]?

Fundamentally, this little guy needs to get involved whenever you need some independent random. Most of the random in this game is tied to the [[PC|PCs]] skills but as they level up that will get less and less random. It can be useful to have 1d6 around as some independent random.

- chaotic sutuations like [[NPC Wars]]
- [[Checks]] that are particularly likely to have side effects

this could easily be independent of the checks system. it probably should be.

This is a guide for drawing realistic maps with identifiable elements that are easy to draw. 
1. Landmasses like continents and islands can easily be created by scattering a handful of [[Dice]], rice, or any other small object on a piece of paper and tracing around them.
2. Mountains can be drawn with many upside down "v" and check-mark shapes or by making a long jagged, lightning-like, line following the ridge of the mountains and adding more jagged and indented lines down to the ground.
3. Rolling hills can be done similar to the "v" method for mountains with the exception that you will want them to be wide, rounded and bell shaped.
4. Water can be indicated with a few serrations pointing upward for still bodies of water. Rivers can be indicated with short parallel lines near the curves in the banks.
5. Trees can be represented well as circles or arrows with stems coming down. This is somewhat laborious however and representing forests as cartoon clouds with many stems along the bottom edge is my preferred method.
6. City maps that look natural can be created by alternating drawing streets and buildings. First draw a single, possibly curved, line to represent the main road. Draw a cross street and put rectangular shapes representing buildings in the corners. Keep doing this until you have filled in the white space allotted to your city.
7. Doors can be indicated by drawing a line for a well and then adding a diagonal line sticking out of the wall in the direction you want the door to swing open.

## plot focused 

map out the things that are going to happen using the typical 3-act play as a guide: 
- Act I – Setup: Exposition, inciting incident, plot point one 
- Act II – Confrontation: Rising action, midpoint, plot point two 
- Act III – Resolution: Pre climax, climax, conclusion
## character focused
if you want a character focused game do the plot focused thing, then this:
1. have your players give you their character backstories/histories.
2. begin connecting elements of the backstories to plot points on a web.

- don't solve problems with magic/tech/[[The Cavalry]] (story), only create them
- magic/deus ex machina should always create more problems than it solves

I have found great success recently in building modules by picking out the props, then the moral, then letting everything in the middle fall into place based on those. For new prospect this meant imagining the "yeehaw above; D&D below" props and the moral that "the town is a machine that consumes life and outputs money". Once I had those in place the rest was easy to finish. Limiting the outer bounds to the town/mine was also helpful.

sandbox games are bad:
how to create a plot
how to create character specific subplots

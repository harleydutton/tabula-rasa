When you find yourself in frequent need of the same type of [[Content]] like names, treasure, traps, enemies or anything else you can make a table. First, decide roughly how big the table should be. Note, high and low results on tables with curved distributions are rarer than those in the middle. 

A group brainstorming sessions is a good way to fill in table results if you are having trouble. Just ask everyone in your group to call out things they think might go on this table and write down the ones you like with until the table is full.

![[Dice]]

There are two styles of notation present in the table below. When you see Xd6 you should roll X [[Dice]] and add them together. When you see 1d66 or 1d666 you should roll as many dice as there are 6's and read the faces sequentially. 

| slots | distribution | notation | range                       |
| ----- | ------------ | -------- | --------------------------- |
| 6     | flat         | 1d6      | 1,2,3,4,5,6                 |
| 36    | flat         | 1d66     | 11,12,13,14,15,16,21,...,66 |
| 216   | flat         | 1d666    | 111,112,...,665,666         |
| 11    | curved       | 2d6      | 2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11       |
| 16    | curved       | 3d6      | 3,4,5,...,16,17,18          |
| 21    | curved       | 4d6      | 4,5,6,...,22,23,24          |

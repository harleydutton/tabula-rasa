When I was speaking with Ethan about character progression, the concept of terminal motivations came up. Most characters have a reason to begin adventuring, and it might be a good idea to mandate that all characters have a goal which,  once reached, signals the end of their time as an adventurer. This will likely tie into hooks and the storybuilding framework.

Perhaps (at least) one long term and one short term goal?

it's good for characters to retire sometimes. something about motivations.

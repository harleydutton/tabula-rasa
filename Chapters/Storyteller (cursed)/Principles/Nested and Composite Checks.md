- character is attempting two non-trivial actions (checks) at the same time
	- in combat this consumes both [[Main Action]] and [[Supporting Action]]
	- action dependent on or simultaneously with another action
- try single check first
	- increased difficulty
	- switch to attribute
- nested check
	- difficulty of second check influenced by first check outcome
		- can make second check impossible
- composite check
	- each check maximum successes is 1
	- both checks contribute to a single outcome

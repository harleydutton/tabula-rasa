Once the number of NCPs gets into the double digits it doesn't make a whole lot of sense to actually play the individual characters in combat. In this case the NPC battle is narrated with the PC party being able to influence the outcome through their success or failure in smaller battles where most of the combatants matter. When the storyteller's turns for the NPCs end up being more long than is funit's probably a good time to change things to a simultaneous battle and war.

I think [[The Event Die]] can be useful with something like this. maybe some [[Chapters/Storyteller (cursed)/Toolkit/Clocks|Clocks]] too. I'm not convinced this is a tabula specific thing. might belong in toolkit

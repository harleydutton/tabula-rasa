Some NPCs don't need full character sheets because they show up to make a handful of roles--sometimes just one--and are never seen again. Try not to roll more dice for skills or attributes than the players would for their highest skill or attribute, but given that, just roll however many dice you feel is appropriate to represent the competency of the temporary NPC. It may be relevant to write down the stats you give the NPC as you can reverse engineer how much experience they have in order to fill out the rest of their stats if they end up becoming an NPC you keep around for longer.

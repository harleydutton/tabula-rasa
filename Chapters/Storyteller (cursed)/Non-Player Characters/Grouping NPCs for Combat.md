I guess my first suggestion would be to have grouped enemies only have one body and  therefore one or two effective health each.

The second suggestion would be to have groups of enemies always act on the same tick and make a bunch of attacks for their squad at the same speed. This is better than giving them a very fast speed because you don't have to scale it back as members of the group die.

This means you only really need to track their reactions and how many of them are alive.

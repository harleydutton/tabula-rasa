One method of maintaining a safe game is to allow everyone--[[Player|Players]] and [[Storyteller]] alike--an easy way to indicate that they are uncomfortable with the current roleplay. The X-card is simply an index card with an "X" drawn on it. Hold it up, touch it, say "X-Card", type "X" in chat, or cross your arms over your chest in an "X" to indicate you are uncomfortable with the current roleplay. If someone at your table does this you should stop and make sure they are okay. Then the group should update the [[Lines and Veils]] on the [[World Sheet]] and then skip past or remove whatever content made that person uncomfortable.

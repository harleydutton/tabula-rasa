A common reason for new content to be rejected is because of theme. Don't try to play a wizard in a non-magic world. Don't try to play a jedi in a medieval world. Sure there are storytellers who will jump at that but try to stay within the themes outlined in the world document.

Each world has a theme. It might be the wild west with cowpokes getting into brawls and lobbing dynamite off of trains. It might be an epic swords and sorceries adventure. It might be a modern day espionage story with lots of gunfights and back alley deals. It might be the far flung future with spaceships battling around every asteroid. The point is that players should try to match their characters to the theme of the world as well as they can. Usually the storyteller doesn't enjoy telling you you cannot play a wizard in the story about space pirates.

Limiting the when and where [[Content]] can be used is a good way to [[Balance]] it. Some example contexts are as follows:
- Must have line of sight to the target
- Must be touching target
- Must have a sympathetic link to the target
- Must be calm to use
- Can only use during the day
- Can only use if unseen

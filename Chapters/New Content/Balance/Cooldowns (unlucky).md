Powerful effects can warp a game if they are used too frequently. Adding a cooldown is a good way to prevent overuse. :
	- Refreshes at sunup or sundown
	- Refreshes at the beginning of [[Downtime]]
	- 
	- refreshes randomly on your turn
	- refreshes after a random number of turns
	- doesn't refresh

borg uses 1d6+x uses per day and a magical misshaps table to balance all the powers. This works well. Check limits. I think i was already planning something like this.

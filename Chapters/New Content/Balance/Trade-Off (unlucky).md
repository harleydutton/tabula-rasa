as a limit, the basic aspect of a trade off is that to get this thing you have to give up something else either forever--or at the very least so long as you have whatever the trade-off is a limit for.

- all backgrounds should have trade-offs to make players not want to take a shitpile of them. originally the idea was that they include some form of negative background. perhaps they could give -1's to attributes?
- canadela obscura does a thing where you get [+1,+1,+1,(+1,-1)] as a sequence of skill upgrades. I'm not sure I can use this system to benefit mine but it is the inspiration.

- find a way to model proportional trade-offs (for backgrounds)
- as the storyteller, you can expect to see a proposed trade-off come with the (background) proposal
- there should be a shared goal of proportionality between the player and storyteller.

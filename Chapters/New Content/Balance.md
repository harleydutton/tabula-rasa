One of the trickiest parts of [[New Content Negotiation]] is letting a [[Player]] have the content they want without accidentally giving their [[Character]] control of reality. This is a list of ways [[Content]] can be modified to prevent or fix that problem.
- [[Cooldowns]]
- [[Context]]
- [[Need]]
- [[Power Level]]
- [[Rarity]]
- [[Risk]]
- [[Scope (unlucky)]]
- [[Taboo]]
- [[Timing]]
- [[Trade-Off (unlucky)]]

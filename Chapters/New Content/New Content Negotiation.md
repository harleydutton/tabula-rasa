  - Negotiate New Content

This page details a process for creating new [[Content]]. When a [[Player]] wants to add something to the [[World]] they should start a conversation with the [[Storyteller]]. Below is a way to organize that conversation so the process goes smoothly:
1. A player proposes new content that isn't [[Banned Content]] and includes:
	- Name
	- Description
	- Some attempt at [[Balance]]
2. At which point the storyteller has a few options:
	1. Accept proposal "as is" and add the content it describes to the [[World Sheet]]
	2. [[Balance]] until satisfied, then add to the world sheet
	3. [[Veto]] the proposed content

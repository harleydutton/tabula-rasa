The [[Storyteller]] can reject proposed [[Content]] that isn't listed as [[Banned Content]] by vetoing it. If they do this, they add something to the banned content list to attempt to avoid such issues in the future. Whatever is added to the list should try to ban things like the vetoed content, not just the vetoed content.

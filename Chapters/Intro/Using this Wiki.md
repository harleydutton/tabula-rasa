Unlike most roleplaying systems, I am publishing [[index|Tabula Rasa]] as a wiki rather than a book. This has a few implications:
- You cannot read it cover to cover like a book. Instead you should open links to unfamiliar topics, learn about them, and eventually find your way back to where you started.
- There isn't an index because the there is a table of contents and a search bar on the left hand side of the page.
- There are some cool technologies involved! Backlinks allow you to see all the pages linking to the page you are on which can be pretty handy.

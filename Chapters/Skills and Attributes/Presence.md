Presence is the [[Attribute]] for all things social.
- A [[Character]] with more [[Damage]] associated with presence than levels in it is [[Death|Dead]].
- If a character does not have an appropriate [[Skills|Skill]], presence can be used to make [[Checks]] that are more social than mental, physical, or supernatural.

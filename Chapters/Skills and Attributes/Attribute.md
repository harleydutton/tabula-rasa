The attributes are [[Mind]], [[Body]], [[Spirit]], and [[Presence]]. Every [[Character]] gets the first level in each for free. Beyond the first level, they can be leveled up using the [[Quadratic Scaling]] chart.

Attributes are used for two things:
- Determining how much [[Damage]] a character can have before they are [[Death|Dead]].
- Making a [[Checks|Check]] without an appropriate [[Skills|Skill]].

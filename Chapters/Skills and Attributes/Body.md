Body is the [[Attribute]] for all things physical:
- A [[Character]] with more [[Damage]] associated with body than levels in it is [[Death|Dead]].
- If a character does not have an appropriate [[Skills|Skill]], body can be used to make [[Checks]] that are more physical than the mental, supernatural, or social.

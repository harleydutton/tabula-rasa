Mind is the [[Attribute]] for all things mental:
- A [[Character]] with more [[Damage]] associated with mind than levels in it is [[Death|Dead]].
- If a character does not have an appropriate [[Skills|Skill]], mind can be used to make [[Checks]] that are more mental than the physical, supernatural, or social.

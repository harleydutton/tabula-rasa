Spirit is the [[Attribute]] for all things supernatural:
- A [[Character]] with more [[Damage]] associated with spirit than levels in it is [[Death|Dead]].
- If a character does not have an appropriate [[Skills|Skill]], spirit can be used to make checks that are more supernatural than the mental, physical, or social.

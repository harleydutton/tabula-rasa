The in-game doors that position and status unlock are also represented by flavor. Typically this might look like `respected businessman`, `landed noble`, `kings advisor`, or `internet personality`. The effect of this stuff is purely RP and it will be up to the player to use it to its fullest. A character's job is always worth having as flavor because this has social implications in most societies. A character may or may not have a reputation but if they do it is worth putting down what it is and what group of people will know about it.

This sounds nice and broad. probably has a relevant flavor from each category of [[Damage]], [[Background|Backgrounds]], and [[Items]]

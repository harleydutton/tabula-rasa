Whenever a [[Character]] takes damage, like from an attack ([[Main Action]]) in [[Combat]], it should be represented as a [[Background]]. All damage should have the potential to result in character [[Death]]. Damage comes in many forms (physical, mental, spiritual, social) but it should always be associated with one, specific [[Attribute]] and noted as such. This is so you know it is damage and not just a normal background:
- [[Body]] damage includes like stab wounds, poison, broken bones, severed limbs, etc.
- [[Mind]] damage includes delirium, paranoia, shell shock, forgetfulness, etc.
- [[Spirit]] damage includes hauntings, curses, unnatural compulsions, possession, etc.
- [[Presence]] damage includes debts, bad reputation, disfiguring wounds, etc.

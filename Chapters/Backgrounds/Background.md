```
Descriptors are just a couple English words that describe one of the in game concepts below:
- [[Items]], which are things you have
- [[Background]], which are things you are and things you know perfectly
- [[Damage]], which are things that affect you in a temporary fashion

Descriptors are usually put on lists on your character sheet and represent everything about your character that isn't purely mechanical.

[[Wealth]] -> Items handles the things a character has. These are still descriptor.
[[big Skills]] handle the things a character can do imperfectly.
[[Background|Backgrounds]] handles the things a character is or knows. is still descriptor
descriptors are linear (one CP gets you one flavor)
[[Damage]] are descriptors, and "the things that affect a character in a temporary way"

> flavor comment
> you have not described in any way what the practical benefit of flavors might be. this is particularly a problem in this section because you have described what the /cost/ of a basic flavor is, and what the /cost/ of a  'particularly powerful' flavor might be, but at this point no one has any idea of what the purpose of flavor is supposed to be in the first place. This persists into the boons section.

Flavor is a mechanic in Tabula used to describe the interesting parts of a character. Almost anything unique that a character _is_ or _has_ is likely to be flavor. Flavor is used primarily for DTMS (does this make sense) checks and modifying the difficulty on checks. Flavor cannot refer to any part of the system, including AD, skills, or attributes. A few examples of flavor might be `armor`, `horse`, `landed noble`, `flaming sword`, `elf`, `big and tall`, etc. for an elvish knight of the summer court. Each piece of flavor should be a short, evocative description.

Flavor is a word or short phrase describing your character. While you could say your character has clothes and the ability to speak, let’s not worry about that and instead focus on the things that spice your character up! Flavor can include knowledge, possessions, physique, and even social position. Most flavor costs one CP at character creation or one hook for those which are particularly powerful. More flavor can be obtained or inflicted later on in the game.

Flavor is a word or short (two-word) phrase describing your character and it is how you give your character personality and make them unique. While you could say your character has clothes and the ability to speak, let's not worry about that and instead focus on the things that spice your character up! You aren’t just a rebel with a cause, you’re a smokin’ hot rebel with a cause.

Flavor can include knowledge, possessions, physique, and even social position. Flavor costs one [character point](#_o3tr0ykifwm1) (CP) at character creation and can be obtained later in the game at storyteller discretion. The storyteller can inflict flavor upon characters during the story. When resolving a conflict using a check, flavor can sometimes modify the roll making it more or less likely that you succeed. This should not be a piece of flavor’s only purpose.

Third, your character needs [flavor](#flavor). Flavor is a word or short phrase describing a character. It can include knowledge, possessions, physique, and even social position. Review the starting flavor options listed on the world. This will almost always give your character a language, clothes, and equipment relevant for the world. When the world specifies a type of flavor but not what it is specifically you get to choose something that would fit within the world. Add your choice of starting flavor to your character sheet. Afterward, add flavor to your character to describe them. Flavor costs one character point per after you have your starting flavor. Flavor is usually just that, flavor, but occasionally it can make checks easier or harder.

IIRC flavor was short descriptive words or phrases that would give +1 or -1 in situations in which they applied. Ciazio stacked "strong" worded a few different ways and had a +4. balance this.
"flavor" is a short description of anything a character knows, owns, has or is (including reputation, status, and position). these should be the videogame equivalent of passives rather than actives. they can modify checks by a small value but they are not check themselves.
flavor is anything a character is or has: physical attributes (horns, fins, cybernetic implants), magical, social, mental, or a material possessions.
flavor should not have numbers attached to it.
flavor can be acquired at CC and either purchased with exp or acquired through roleplaying.
Duplicate flavor should not stack for determining modifiers for checks. Unique flavors should. (strong, buff, muscley = +1 vs big, strong = +2 to a strength check or something)
At one point i had something named traits/passive abilities/backgrounds. these were very, very similar to flavor. they cannot be leveled up and they cannot be taught. those two restrictions were important for defining what was and was not a trait and it could be useful for defining flavor.
here is a list of example flavor:
Examples: These are some examples of flavor. Some are normal, some are special, some are bad. Captain of the guard. Beautiful singing voice. Strong. Wise. Recognizable facial scar. Pathological liar. Sociopath. Owns a horse. Is liked by horses. Centaur. Gambling problem. Charming. Attractive. Fast. Knowledgeable. Lord of a castle. Friends in high places. Rich. Night vision. Night vision goggles. Owns a spaceship. Carries a spear and club. Leper. Reputation for beating priests. Kind. King’s advisor. Drug dealer. Librarian. Has many rare books. Orc. Insane. Insomniac. Carnivorous. Extra limbs. Amputee. Crippled. Talks to plants. Plants talk to me. Holy. Incorporeal. Haunted by past crimes. Haunted by angry ghosts. Has a compass. Stubborn. Magically adept. Bloodthirsty. Good manners. Boxing world champion. Dropped out of medical school. Cult leader. Shift manager at a fast food joint. Famous space pirate. Infertile. Has many decks of cards. Knows Spanish. Is Spanish. Can play the flute. Religious. Sneaky. Large. Fat. Boring. Knows the location of buried treasure. Student at Yale. Responsible for a princeling. Young and stupid. Evil. Charitable.

 - define flavor better. Heuristic: flavor represents thing you are or have
Flavor == adjectives and nouns?
skill == verbs?
flavor cannot point to a specific [[Skills]]. If a flavor boils down to "+1 to a [[Skills]]" or "X [[Skills]] is easy for me" it isn't really flavor. Instead it should have many ups and downs and they should be situational.

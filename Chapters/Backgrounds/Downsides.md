Backgrounds do not cost [[Experience]], therefore they cannot just be [[Balance|Balanced]] and must have explicit downsides. For every door a background opens for a [[Character]] it should close another. For this reason, it is my hope, you will make relatively tame backgrounds and take few of them. Lastly, it is not always an option but equal and opposite is a simple and effective method of creating downsides for a background.

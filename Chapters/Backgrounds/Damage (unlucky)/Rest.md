- the notion here is that at [[Downtime]] [[Damage]] turn into [[Background|Backgrounds]] or go away
- maybe also implement a system where two damages go away and you get a third, new damage

from bad rep

healing:
- reputation can be localized so leaving town might make your bad rep cease to matter.
- time usually causes grudges to be forgotten. consult your [[Storyteller]] at downtime. options include:
	- guaranteed healing (the bad rep just goes away at downtime)
	- random healing that is independent of player stats ([[The Event Die]])
	- random healing that is dependent on player stats ([[Presence]] [[Checks|Check]])
	- bad rep goes down a stage (group|individual(s)|nobody)
	- you can try and patch things up by makeing reparations through RP, probably requiring Presence Checks
	- or any combination of the above

from curses:
healing it:
- atonement, repentance, penance, etc. based on the god/code:
	- you must try to undo the thing
	- you must sacrifice something
	- you have to figure out how to talk to your higher power and get a pardon

- damage can become [[Background|Backgrounds]] at [[Downtime]]. [[Rest]]

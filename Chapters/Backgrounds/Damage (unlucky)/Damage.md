Whenever a [[Character]] takes damage, like from an attack ([[Main Action]]) in [[Combat]], it should be represented as a [[Background]]. Damage comes in many forms (physical, mental, spiritual, social) but it should always be associated with one, specific [[Attribute]] and noted as such so you know it is damage and not a normal [[Background]]:
- [[Body]] damage includes thing like stab wounds, poison, broken bones, severed limbs, etc.
- [[Mind]] damage includes delirium, paranoia, shell shock, forgetfulness, etc.
- [[Spirit]] damage includes hauntings, curses, unnatural compulsions, possession, etc.
- [[Presence]] damage includes debts, bad reputation, disfiguring wounds, etc.

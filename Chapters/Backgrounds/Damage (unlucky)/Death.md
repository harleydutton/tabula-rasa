A [[Character]] is becomes unplayable when they accumulate more [[Damage]] associated with an [[Attribute]] than they have levels in that attribute. This can mean they have died, gone insane, been possessed, gone to prison, or anything else that seems appropriate for the attribute and the circumstances under which they gain their final [[Damage]]. This is a good time to make a new character unless your [[Storyteller]] says otherwise.

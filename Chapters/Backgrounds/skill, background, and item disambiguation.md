- knowledges
	- if you can fail it's a skill
	- if you can't it is (part of) a background

heuristic: describe how the content applies to a character with the fewest words
- if the verb is a conjugated form of "to be" (is, are, were, etc.) then it's a background
- if the verb is "have" or "own" it's an item
- if it's a power/ability that lets you do new stuff then the verb is probably "can", "able to", or some action verb.

this is temporarily in the backgrounds chapter so i can extract all the relevant stuff. It will live in the [[Storyteller]] chapter eventually. might also be where I put the flowchart.

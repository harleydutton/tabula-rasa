heuristic: describe, in as few words as possible, how the new content would hypothetically affect your character and pay attention to the verb.

- things you "are" = [[Background|Backgrounds]] (and [[Damage]])
- things you "own" = [[Items]]
- things you "do" = [[Skills]]

double check to make sure skills are fallible and backgrounds are not.

---

- knowledges
	- if you can fail it's a skill
	- if you can't it is (part of) a background

---

- knowledge: sometimes a skill, sometimes a background. depends on certainty

this is temporarily in the backgrounds chapter so i can extract all the relevant stuff. It will live in the [[Storyteller]] chapter eventually. might also be where I put the flowchart.

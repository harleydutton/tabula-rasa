For a [[Checks|Check]] to be rolled the [[Storyteller]] must set the difficulty as one of "trivial, "easy", "moderate", "hard", or "impossible". This judgement should consider the inherent difficulty of the action, the [[Background|Backgrounds]] of all [[Character|Characters]] involved, and any other context that seems relevant. This subjective difficulty translates directly to a target number for the check, meaning only dice that roll greater than or equal to the target number count as successes.

| Difficulty | Target Number                     |
| ---------- | --------------------------------- |
| Trivial    | All dice are successes            |
| Easy       | All dice 4 or above are successes |
| Moderate   | All dice 5 or above are successes |
| Hard       | All dice showing 6 are successes  |
| Impossible | All dice are failures             |

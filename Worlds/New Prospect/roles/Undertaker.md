The Undertaker dutifully strips people of their remaining valuables and buries them in the cemetery. Requires a payment if there is no loot on the body. Best person to go to when looking into the history of [[New Prospect]]. Seems to think the way people died is more important than who they were to others. Might mention the founding of the town in 1858 when the riches of the [[Mine]] were discovered, the dysentery outbreak in 1866 if prodded, or warn against digging too deep like they did in Prospect and Silverton.

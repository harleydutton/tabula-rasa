The first thing [[Player]] [[Character|Characters]] should encounter if they leave [[New Prospect]] on foot is a farmhouse. There shouldn't be anything growing, just an old woman with a shotgun and a big dog on the porch. She should tell them to "Turn aroun' and head back inta town. Ain't nothin' out here but bandits and death." If they ignore her warning they should be attacked by [[Bandits]] soon after.

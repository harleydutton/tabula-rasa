nod is a dreamlike place where you are meant to question your reality

I have just had the though that slavery, prison, and capitalisim are decreasingly bad because they deny people their humanity (in decreasing order). Following this train of thought and thinking of certain friends and family, what is a society to do when someone becomes a capital P problem? The most ethical solution seemed to be sticking them in cryo-tube prison like they do in altered carbon but also combine it with virtual therapy.

I think it could be very interesting to include themes of group therapy in nod. perhaps also lots of moral tests and simple, "just do normal human shit" shaped tasks. I think I want the players to "get" the gig eventually so I should occasionally let the curtain slip.

Nod also includes many elements intended to make players question their reality and personhood. Perhaps one condition for early release from cryp-prison-matrix-therapy is that players take a firm stance on what is real and what isn't. Perhaps another condition is that they be correct.

The idea of assigning a C.O.N.C.I.E.N.C.E. to each character tickles me. This would be a robot that flies and follows characters around watching them and delivering Pavlovian conditioning in the form of candy/chocolate and spray-bottle squirts.

I think a good place to start a game in Nod would be with the release of the Group (group, capital G, should be a term that comes up a lot) from.

Each player should probably have a rap sheet you or they define in order to make the morality tests thing easier to do.

all temptations from the straight and narrow and departures from reality should be themed as white rabbits.

this should be very groundhog day in nature with players being "released" many times. Whenever one or most (your choice) of the characters fail to be normal-fucking-people-in-society pig-themed cops come, beat the shit out of them and put them back in jail, where they are then released. This is mostly a way to keep the party together and keep things on the rails.

there should specifically be no theme for behaving well other than the conscience drones. this makes the point of nod to teach people consensus reality and the "wrong" half of right and wrong

- This setting should be representative. There should be a variety of nationalities and LGBTQ representation among the NPCs.
	- English,African,Mexican,French,Chinese,German,Russian, etc.
	- there should be queer people and not just in the brothel
	- update the various npcs to reflect this
- add some example content to the mine
- untangle this branch from the descriptors branch :(
- include some kind of note on safety and representation as we are dealing with a real place in a fictional setting.
- make the [[New Prospect]] note into an example world sheet
- change [[New Prospect]] into a [[World Sheet]] and add touchstones to it

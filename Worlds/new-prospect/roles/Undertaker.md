The Undertaker dutifully strips people of their remaining valuables and buries them in the cemetery. He is a man of few words but the best person to go to when looking into the history of [[New Prospect]]. He seems to think the way people died is more important than who they were to others. He might mention the founding of the town in 1858, warn against digging too deep like they did in Prospect and Silverton, or the dysentery outbreak in 1866 if prodded.

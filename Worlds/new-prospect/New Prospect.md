## About
Name: New Prospect
Description: New prospect is a small mining town on the end of the new rail line in 1869 Utah. Folk from all over are drawn in by stories of fabulous riches unrivaled since the California gold rush of 1849.
Touchstones: Above ground the town of New Prospect is similar to the one seen in the movie High Plains Drifter. Below ground, the mine is a D&D dungeon, and imagining The Lord of The Rings would put in the right ballpark.

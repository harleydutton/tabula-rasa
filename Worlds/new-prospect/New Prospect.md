## About
Name: New Prospect
Description: Small, fictitious, old-west town called New Prospect. Set in 1869, Utah. The stories of wealth in the nearby mine bring people to town and it's denizens put them in the cemetery.
Touchstones: Above ground the town of New Prospect is similar to the one seen in the movie High Plains Drifter. Below ground, the mine is a D&D dungeon, with some optional old-west spice.

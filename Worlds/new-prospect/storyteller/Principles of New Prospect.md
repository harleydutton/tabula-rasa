  - Principle of New Prospect

- The gameplay loop for this game is simple, combat focused and very much on rails. Go into the [[Mine]], fight, come out with riches, spend them, repeat. It relies on the "strike it rich" gold rush mentality of the time.
- This [[World]] is intended to be hyper-lethal. TPKs are expected. The [[Cemetery]] is ever-expanding and the [[Train]] constantly brings in fresh meat.
- Instead of full NPCs I provide you, the storyteller, with roles. These are character outlines that tell you what each should do in your story but leaves the details open to you to define.
- New prospect is intended to be a closed system. As such, travel out of town is very limited.
	- The [[Mine]] is ultimately a dead end and characters who enter must eventually return to New Prospect or perish there.
	- Characters can head [[Back East]] and retire provided they do not have a loan with the [[Bank]].
	- If anyone tries to leave town on foot or horse refer to the [[Hoodoos]] section. They should be warned back to town. If they ignore the warning the should be killed.
- Endings I have imagined:
	- The Good: The point of this world is to teach players that the very capitalistic machine formed by the NPCs is evil (even if it is fun) and the good ending is to in some way destroying that town-shaped machine. To this end, if one character in a role dies they should be replaced in the next couple sessions but if the players make a concerted effort to kill or ruin or depose everyone in town that should be allowed.
	- The Bad: The player characters experience success and wealth in new prospect and decide to retire back east, perpetuating the stories of it's riches while leaving the machine intact. The train arrives with fresh miners the next week.
	- The Ugly: The [[Mine]] should get progressively more dangerous and more lucrative but eventually the players dig *too* deep. Something awakens and  and wake something up that comes out and destroys the town killing *everyone* including the player characters. The [[Undertaker]] should attempt to foreshadow this.

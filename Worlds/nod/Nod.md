- nod is a trap and it tries to keep you there, everyone in nod tries to keep you there, and you will eventually try to keep you there
- it's filled with clones, holograms, illusionists, shapeshifters, simulated reality, anti-aging, spies, sleeper agents, dopplegangers, bodyswitching, will-o-the-wisps, etc. 
- I think even death will not be an escape there might be a real escape but the only real escape is acceptance as if you die you should walk into the room immediately as a hologram/clone/shapeshifter/the real you
- themes should include masks, isekai shit like truck kun, white rabbits, 
- should have a high tech fey feel to it
- there should be poetry scattered around
- being on the correct path to escape should give you an ominous or creepy vibe
	- mantra-ey things like "follow the white rabbit. follow the white rabbit. follow the white rabbit..." work well. "all work and no play makes jack a dull boy"
- everything should be high tech and have an oldtimey/fantacy name
- should maybe play on nod being easy of eden in biblical/cainite mythology. perhaps more biblical elements will be used to a purpose
- there should be plenty of fantastical things like giant people that are all holograms or something
- this place should have brave new world vibes in that it gives you dopamine in order to prevent you from escaping: sex, drugs, BTL, gambling, etc.
- nod should be a city whose layout is a literal maze of buildings where things move around
- perpetual twilight, nod is the city that never sleeps for real, yo.
- nod should have many names: the drift, somnus, nod, 
- hotel california is the soundtrack right before the climax
- make sure player characters have strong motivations
- cyberpunk body-mods are available
- nod is the frame story; I need a picture story:
	- perhaps each character is looking for some piece of information that is important to them

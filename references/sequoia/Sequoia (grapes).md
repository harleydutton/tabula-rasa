[[organization decisions]] [[naming decisions]] [[design decisions]] I am coming to the concluison that the actual worldbuilding framework used doesn't matter much. The only part tabula requires is the parts that explicitly interact with it's rules. I think this means everything in the descripions section is optional: History, economy, religion, magic, tech, geography and weather, flora and fauna, cultures, and governments?

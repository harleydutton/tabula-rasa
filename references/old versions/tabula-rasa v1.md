# Tabula Rasa

## Intro

Tabula Rasa is a worldbuilding framework and a rules-light, generic roleplaying game that lets players create their own skills.

The worldbuilding framework produces a Setting. Settings are short, standardized, and easily sharable descriptions of a single place within a world. The intent is that Settings can be used to quickly understand a part of the world such that a player can create a Character or the Storyteller can create an Adventure.

The roleplaying system is generic so it will work with any Setting produced by the worldbuilding framework. The rules are minimal meaning you and your group should be able to create any character imaginable within the setting and start playing very quickly!

<!-- /TOC -->

## Getting Started
To start an Adventure you will need a few things. First and most important, your group will need a Setting so they can do character creation. You can use one of the included Settings, find one online, or make your own by filling out the Setting template. Otherwise you need paper, pencils, six-sided dice, and players. A printer and having your adventure planned out are both highly recommended. Once you have these things proceed to the Character Creation section.
<!-- the bit below needs to be written into the bit above -->
1. The storyteller should visit the [setting](# setting) to create a setting for the story to take place in. 
2. Players should visit the [character creation](#character-creation) section.
3. The storyteller should head over to the [making an adventure](#making-an-adventure) section if they need help with that.
<!--I think a map, a battlegrid, tokens, and cards might also be helpful depending the other rules I include-->

## Character Creation
<!-- I need a link to the setting section.
    I should to talk about what a character needs to be non-mechanically playable-->
Characters need skills, flavor and an action delay to be playable. The first thing a player should do when making a character is take a look at the setting, read through it and make sure they understand the world. Players can propose things be added to the setting because they are supposed to have a mild influence upon what exists within the setting.

First fill out the top of your character sheet. In order, the boxes should contain the character's name, the character's concept, the setting's name, your name, and the setting's action delay. A character concept can be thought of as the canonical or stereotypical version of something. The setting's action delay can be found in the upper left corner of the setting template.

Second, your character needs [skills](#skills). Skills are used to roll checks which is how a character interacts with the game world. Skills are usually self-descriptively named and have levels. The higher level the skill the better at it a character is.
There are two kinds of skills. Mandatory skills and the normal kind. Mandatory skills are skills every character _needs_ within the setting. They are listed at the top of the skills section in the setting. Add all of the mandatory skills to your character sheet. The rest of the skills are those that are common within the setting and you can take any of them you can afford. Players can also propose to the storyteller that skills be added to the setting. You pay for your starting skills using character points. Starting character points are listed in the upper left of the setting. Both types of skill cost a number of character points equal to the level you want the skill to start at.
```
Example mandatory skills: willpower, strength, magic, dexterity, charisma
Example skills: sword fighting, pyromancy, computer hacking, seduction
```

Third, your character needs [flavor](#flavor). Flavor is a word or short phrase describing a character. It can include knowledge, possessions, physique, and even social position. Review the starting flavor options listed on the setting. This will almost always give your character a language, clothes, and equipment relevant for the setting. When the setting specifies a type of flavor but not what it is specifically you get to choose something that would fit within the setting. Add your choice of starting flavor to your character sheet. Afterward, add flavor to your character to describe them. Flavor costs one character point per after you have your starting flavor. Flavor is usually just that, flavor, but occasionally it can make checks easier or harder.

## How to Play
Tabula Rasa is a roleplaying game. For those of you that know what this means please continue to the [Checks](#checks) section. For everyone else, roleplaying is a form of collaborative, improvizational storytelling.

One person, the storyteller, will present a world and a story. The storyteller can use a world, or setting, of their own design or one from popular media. The [setting](#setting) section has more details on what you can expect from this ficticious world. The storyteller is also responsible for giving the world life. They plan out scenes between players, provide the decisions and voice acting for NPCs, and narrate events in the world to drive the story they have planned.

The rest of the people in a roleplaying game are players. Usually, players will create a character for the game. See the [character_creation](#character-creation) section for help with this. Once a player has a character, they will provide voice acting, motivations, and personality for the character in addition to controlling their actions within the fictious realm of the story.

A night of roleplaying usually lasts anywhere from two to six hours and usually includes a variety of scenes. Exhilirating chases, nail-biteing espionage, terrifying battles, grand speeches, descriptions of exotic lands, and of course joking around in and out of character are all hallmarks of good roleplaying.

Most good stories include conflict. This will usually end up being between the the player-characters and either NPCs or some other element in the story. When a conflict arises, resolve it by rolling a skill-check. Please see the [checks](#checks) section for help with this.

### Checks
When conflict occurs during roleplaying the fairest way to resolve it most times is by rolling a skill-check. A skill-check is where one of a character's skills is tested against some number of dice which represent the difficulty of the task. If the character's skill is greater than or equal to the sum of the dice then the character passes the skill-check. Usually this will also mean that whatever the character was attmepting to accomplish succeeds. If the dice are greater than the character's skill level the action fails and something bad might happen. The number of dice depends on the difficulty of the task. Flavor can influence difficulty.

#### Difficulty
The difficulty of a skill check can be modified by a number of things. A character's flavor, other characters, and the world itself can all cause a skill-check to become easier or harder. The storyteller decides if any of these things is meaningful enough to make the roll easy or hard.
```
easy    |   pass if skill >= 1d6
normal  |   pass if skill >= 2d6
hard    |   pass if skill >= 3d6
harder  |   pass if skill >= 4d6
etc.    |   pass if skill >= 5d6
```

#### Nested Checks
If a character is trying to do two things at once, juggling while doing a backflip for instance, just increase the difficulty. If a player is doing two things that are radically different, that is the apropriate time to make two skill checks. (Doing a backflip and casting a spell)

#### Progression
To level up a skill you need to pass skill checks with it. Whenever you pass a skill-check with a skill add one to that skill's experience. When the skill's experience is equal to it's level it levels up and the experience resets to zero. You can only level up a skill at level one by making the check easy.

#### Event Die
The storyteller can introduce the event die whenever they want. Basically when a check is rolled and additional d6 is rolled. If this d6 comes up 1 something bad might happen and if it comes up 6 something good might happen.

#### Gambits
Gambits are where you make a deal with the storyreller to modify the the difficulty of a check, the pass-effect, and the fail-effect. You might ask for something special to happen on a success in exchange for an increase in difficulty.

#### Magnitude of Success
If you ever need a magnitude of success for a roll, like damage or crafting, just roll a single d6 and use this chart.
```
1 pip   |   0%
2 pip   |   20%
3 pip   |   40%
4 pip   |   60%
5 pip   |   80%
6 pip   |   100%
```

#### Example
For example lets say John NPC character wants to do a backflip. The first thing John will do is look for a relevant skill on his character sheet. `Acrobatics`, `athletics`, `dexterity`, `phisique` or anything similar will work for this check. Lets say John has an `acrobatics` score of 11. Lets also say John has the flavor `leg wound` from a fight he got into recently. This would make the check hard, so john would be rolling 3d6 against his 11 in `acrobatics`. Lets say John gets a sum of 10 on the dice. This means John was able to successfully do a backflip despite his `leg wound`.

#### Contests
For contests like arm wrestling, racing, or anything else where two known values are being compared (both character's skill values are known so dice aren't needed) just have each roll a check as normal. Do this until one character fail's a check. If neither character can fail the check the stroyteller decides what happens.

Definition: a skill is something a character can do and more importantly fail at. casting waterbreathing spell vs breathing under water with gills.
new skills start at a level equal to the exp spent on them? new skills need to be apporved by dm. new skills can be leveled up with exp with dm approval.
skills level up once they have been used a number of times equal to their level? when they accumulate succeses and fails equal to level? just one of those?
Skills the players make need to have descriptive names. You should be able to tell what a skill does by reading the name and maybe the description.
A good heuristic for skills might be that they end in "ing" or "ation". Figure out what parts of speech/tense these are.

### Stock Skills
All characters should have the ability to attack, defend, move, hide, see, lie, detect lies, persuade, resist persuasion and much more.
Skills are all made up and characters should be able to do each of these things with their skills. probably more things too. Settings should include a list of stock/common skills. PC-made skills need tohave descriptive names. Other (stock/common) skills should have standardized names for DM sanity.

### limiting factors
at one point i recommended having the DM nerf skills while they were being made. give them a mana cost, or a cooldown, or make them take a long time or whatever to help balance them. this is a good time to say that skills should have a type of action associated with them (major, minor, reaction, etc.) and this should be determined at skill creation.
most of the time limiting factors will need to come out for "magic" skills. a cooldown (recharges on 5 or 6 of 1d6 OR one use per day OR mana), a range restriction (you have to touch them OR be able to see them OR something), or a speed restriction (ritual magic that takes anywhere from a few minutes to a few days and cannot be done in combat).

### nested checks
nested checks provide an additional layer of realism but they also dramatically increase the character's likelihood to fail the check. 

### related skills
if you are good with a poleaxe/polehammer it stands to reason you wouldn't suck with a spear or some other polearm. that being said if your skill is named "polehammering" or some this it wont work with a spear. i think there are a few reasonable solutions.
1. the character takes a new skill at level one.
2. the character takes a new skill at half the level of the old skill.
3. the character renames the skill with DM permission
4. the character can make checks as though they had the new skill with half the old skill's level

### skills when attributes are missing
so if i want to run skills without attributes there will be one major problem. what happens when a character wants to arm wrestle but they don't have the "arm wrestling" or "athletics" skills or a strength attribute. They probably have a "swordfighting" skill or some such but that doesn't apply to the contested check that is the arm wrestling match. They should be kinda good at this kind of thing, right? it just doesn't get represented well. I suppose you could have attributes as incredibly generic skills. perhaps you always get a disadvantage on them? nah, but i do like the idea of having attributes as fairly generic skill checks. it might be a good idea to map out all the usual roleplaying actions and figure out which ones need a check.

### Checks
At some point i though about a magnitude of success table. I don't remember what it was based on. i will probably forgo magnitude of success in this system.
At some point i thought it was  a good idea to have flavor. i think this gave bonuses/detriments on rolls. I still like the idea of flavor. It's bonus should be capped.
stacking modifiers to all rolls based on flavor, equipment, situational modifiers etc. each provides a plus or minus one.

### modifiers
modifiers can be in the form of +1's and -1's or in the form of +1d6 or -1d6.
i like the adding and subtracting of d6's because at that point it is just a question of "is the task normal, particularly easy, or particularly hard?"

### Critical Success and Failure
When you roll the maximum or minimum values on the check dice you get a crit. The roll automatically succeeds or fails and maybe some good/bad stuff happens.

### experience and leveling up and new skills and flavor
get 1-2 exp per session/in-game night.
spend an experience to get the first level in a made-up skill (all skills are made up) but you may have to role-play the acquisition.
i guess you have to rolaply for new "flavor".

### Contests as checks
this looks like it is still using the starwars style checks. all parties roll and magnitude of successes are what matters for eliminating contestants and magnitude of success could determine winners. good and bad stuff could apply to whomever rolled them respectively.
currently i am thinking that checks will involve dice, attributes, and skills with an option +2 or -2 from skills and flavor. i think equipment should probably not contribute to anything except that +2/-2. I think i just want equipment to grant new abilities. i probably don't wan't attributes changing too much throughout a game.

### default skills
attack, defend, hide, observe, lie, detect lies, persuade, resist persuasion

### crafting
previously i advocated for magnitude of success. this was likely due to "the crafting problem". if you don't have magnitude of success for crafting then any sword a blacksmith makes is as good as any other sword in the universe. magnitude of success solved this problem by generating a number you could tack onto the created equipment.
I have though of an alternative to this (crappy) solution to "the crafting problem". Instead of determining the quality of the sword after it is done decide on the quality before the roll is made, apply an equivalently sized bonus or penalty and then make the roll. after that it is simple success/failure. the dm can determine if what is created is anything other than garbage upon failure.
It is worth noting that the crafting problem goes away when you remove the numeric values from combat.

### star wars check system
The basic idea here is that a die is added to checks that represents a constantly shifting landscape. This means good or bad roleplaying events can occur when players roll checks in and out of combat.
***
at some point i liked the star wars RPG system of dice having successes and "good stuff" on them and failures and "bad stuff". this led to a system where you could have phyrric victories and defeats that weren't all bad.
Decide whether or not i want crit successes and/or crit failures.
possibly put crits and crit fails on a separate die to control the probability of such.
buy successes/failures and good/bad stuff with pips on the relevant dice.
should rolls always be opposed?
at some point i was in favor of constructing skill checks based on positive and negative dice. negative dice represented the difficulty of the task and the difficulties resulting from the situation. positive dice would represent the character's skill at the task and any advantages they had towards completing the task. when all the positive and negative dice are rolled successes cancel failures and negatives cancel failures.
very good/bad stuff always overrides the other good/bad in the typical opposed roll.
a check fails if there are fewer successes than failures on the dice. it seems like this system expects you to purchase successes, failures, good stuff, and bad stuff. it also seems like it requires far more than three identical 6ds. it seems like it wants d10s and specfic symbols on those dice.
excess successes and failures contribute to magnitude of success.
excess good stuff and bad stuff mean nothing in particular.
net good/bad stuff means a bunch of good/bad story things happen. this might be a little insane if it happens to often. the DM only has to resolve one good/bad stuff per check

### advantages and disadvantages
this looks like it came from the star wars RP system?
anyway it looks interesting. I cannot tell if it is for combat or all checks or what.
> As a part of any action a character may attempt to create an advantage for themselves. If the action succeeds whomever is controlling the character gets to describe the advantage they create. If the storyteller finds it reasonable it happens. If not, don’t waste time arguing, just move on.
> An advantage can also take the form of having to roll fewer dice on a skill check in the future, extra damage dice on an attack roll, or a bonus to initiative. Inversely an advantage might mean that the character’s opponents have to roll more dice on skill checks, get fewer dice on their damage rolls, or lose initiative.

### called shots and stunt points
exalted, D&D, and Dragon Age: the RPG all had different ways to deal with this. All had their own merits. In D&D you said what you wanted to do ahead of time and it modified the difficulty of the roll. If you were successful it happened. full stop. This involved many tables of modifiers usually and it was a slow process. The Star Wars RPG mitigated this issue by boiling every modifier to a die that got added to the check's pool. It kinda sucked when your checks didn't pass but it was always worded as "I try to" not "I do"
In Dragon Age you rolled the check and then if you got stunt points (based on 2/3 dice matching faces) you got the number of stunt points on the "dragon die" (the first one). This made things go faster but limited options.
Exalted was odd. You actually got "style points" for calling your describing your actions in detail. This resulted in most shots being called shots and having to ret-con cool descriptions when the check didn't pass.

### problems with previous iterations of "players are allowed to create their own skills"
tl;dr players could make skills that were vague and applied to every scenario and then max them.
- using incredibly broad skills that apply to every scenario. "social graces" applies to every social situation, provides little character depth, and makes it so a player can use the dice to walk all over the game.
an example tree of skill scope
> animal skills  
>> riding  
>>> horses  
>>> camels  
>>> elephants  
>> driving  
>>> oxen  
>>> mules and horses  
>>> dogs  
>> care  
>>> grooming  
>>> feeding  
>>> breeding  
>>> veterinary  
>>>> first aid  
>>>> diagnosis  
>>>> medicine  
>>>> surgery    
A character might know “knots” because they know the skill “sailing” and that’s fine even though the character is getting a lot of skills for free under the umbrella-skill of “sailing”. 
On the other hand I encouraged THIS at one point.
perhaps settings should include a list of default/common skills?
there is something of a goldilocks zone for skill scope. Magic is too broat, fireball is too narrow, but fire magic is just right.

### skill check
a check should probably involve dice, maybe equipment, a base stat, a specialization stat, perhaps another specialization stat, and situational modifiers.

### leveling up
at one point i was in love with the idea that leveling up a skill was done by using it. this would mean you have to accumulate successes, failures, or both equal to something (the skills level) to level it up
I also liked the idea of having traditional floating experience level up skills at some rate. it was also nice being able to transition smoothly from character creation to playing the game with VTM esque bonus points being the same as exp




















### flavor
IIRC flavor was short descriptive words or phrases that would give +1 or -1 in situations in which they applied. Ciazio stacked "strong" worded a few different ways and had a +4. balance this.
"flavor" is a short description of anything a character knows, owns, has or is (including reputation, status, and position). these should be the videogame equivalent of passives rather than actives. they can modify checks by a small value but they are not check themselves.
flavor is anything a character is or has: physical attributes (horns, fins, cybernetic implants), magical, social, mental, or a material possessions.
flavor should not have numbers attached to it.
flavor can be acquired at CC and either purchased with exp or acquired through roleplaying.
Duplicate flavor should not stack for determining modifiers for checks. Unique flavors should. (strong, buff, muscley = +1 vs big, strong = +2 to a strength check or something)
At one point i had something named traits/passive abilities/backgrounds. these were very, very similar to flavor. they cannot be leveled up and they cannot be taught. those two restrictions were important for defining what was and was not a trait and it could be useful for defining flavor.
here is a list of example flavor:
Examples: These are some examples of flavor. Some are normal, some are special, some are bad. Captain of the guard. Beautiful singing voice. Strong. Wise. Recognizable facial scar. Pathological liar. Sociopath. Owns a horse. Is liked by horses. Centaur. Gambling problem. Charming. Attractive. Fast. Knowledgeable. Lord of a castle. Friends in high places. Rich. Night vision. Night vision goggles. Owns a spaceship. Carries a spear and club. Leper. Reputation for beating priests. Kind. King’s advisor. Drug dealer. Librarian. Has many rare books. Orc. Insane. Insomniac. Carnivorous. Extra limbs. Amputee. Crippled. Talks to plants. Plants talk to me. Holy. Incorporeal. Haunted by past crimes. Haunted by angry ghosts. Has a compass. Stubborn. Magically adept. Bloodthirsty. Good manners. Boxing world champion. Dropped out of medical school. Cult leader. Shift manager at a fast food joint. Famous space pirate. Infertile. Has many decks of cards. Knows Spanish. Is Spanish. Can play the flute. Religious. Sneaky. Large. Fat. Boring. Knows the location of buried treasure. Student at Yale. Responsible for a princeling. Young and stupid. Evil. Charitable. 

### equipment
i think tabula lets players make their own gear too? equipment has no numeric values. instead just describe the equipment. equipment should give characters new active abilities or modify their existing active abilities. items should have made up special abilities. crappy lockpicks break after a failed attempt but a nice lockpicking set gives you two or three tries.

### character progression
i don't want to tell anyone how to do down-time but it is relevant for a few things in this system. first off if can be used to experience whore. i will probably make it so you can increment attributes by one during downtime and you cannot improve skills during downtime. downtime is also a good time to heal wounds.
























## Combat
It looks like i was favoring shadowrun style initiative/speed in the past
disallowing called shots in favor of the doubles -> dragon dice method from dragon age seems really good. shadowrun style initiative is where characters roll initiative and get a score, and then combat goes in rounds. Each round subtracts some number (10 in shadowrun) from each intiative and each character that still has a non-negative initiative score gets a turn.

### Attacking
i wonder if i should even have a damage roll. perhaps doing damage in some deterministic fashion might be better. i would like to avoid having health and mana. I would also like to avoid the consept of leveling up
having a sword should not modify the attach roll; it should just allow you do deal "sword" damage, like decapitating, impaling, cutting etc...

### combat transitions
at one point I had a system designed that would allow for seamless transitions between stealth, combat, and chases. I think this effectively just used shadowrun initiative for combat and chases and made it so stealth granted an initiative bonus

### distance
distance is an important part of combat. In the interest of avoiding specifics I think I will describe distances as AUDs or Arbitrary Units of Distance. These are equivalent to one square of graph paper or one square on a battle grid.
Rather than using a battle-grid you might also use a sketch of the map with a very loose grid of "zones" over the top. Zones take one movement action to move between. This works best when zones are easy to define like rooms in buildings.

### group combat
this looks fucking awful... division??? wtf?
attacker defender meaning
individual individual spend MP SP or FP to get additional damage dice
individual group mtf fireball styled costs
group individual multiply damage by group size
group group multiply by attackers and divide by defenders

### action economy
this is actually a pretty good idea. figure out how to implement it and classify actions in this game. major, minor, full, free, reaction etc. (mental, channeled,passive, teamwork action,) can players get additional actions? how?initiative and turn order

### faster and slower characters
this system doesn't have a good way to give players additional actions by default. it also doesn't have a good way to represent that one character is slower than the rest except by making all the other players in the combat faster. furthermore meaningful speed differences aren't usually fun in combat. therefore this system has all characters acting at about the same speed. additional actions can still be granted at the DM's discretion.

### grouping NPCS
provide some simple method of grouping NPCs in combat

### Armor
Armor should subtract from damage dealt
previously i had the idea that armor would contribute an integer value to an armor score for each piece of armor. (+3 helmet, +2 leather breeches, +7 chestplate, +5 shield = 17 armor score)
there are some problems with armor. first it can have more than one stat and they aren't related. there is hardness which determines what kind of attacks it will stop (soak). there is coverage which determines what percentage of your body it covers and this + dex might create a target number for to-hit checks against the character. lastly there is encumberance which can be positively or negatively affected by armor (normal plate, mithril-light-as-a-feather-BS-armor, and mjolnir power armor that actually makes the user stronger)
furthermore the AC thing isn't a particularly good metric for avoiding explosions but the encumberance value is as far as making checks goes. furthermore the encumberance value could have different effects on stealth and athletics/acrobatics checks. I really don't think it is worth statting all this shit out.

### Dodge
Dodge should be the opposition to to-hit rolls. think about armor coverage vs armor hardness. i also have the idea that the only way to avoid damage that has independently passed the to-hit stage is to use a reaction to dodge.
I like the notion that dodging should require a reaction. At storyteller discretion dodging some things might take a reaction and then some. I would say that to "dodge" an explosion you need to get out of it and that would require a move action as well.

### Damage, Wounds, and Death
In the current moment i vote for either perma-death or no relevant hitpoints.
damage is dealt as flavor. no bookkeeping for hitpoints!!!
if damage uses dice it should use a maximum of 2d6.
A "wound" is bad flavor gotten through combat from taking damage. Wounds give a -1 to all checks due to pain and possibly disability.
At one point I was keen on the idea that wounds and damage could be exchanged but the implementation requires me to make a bunch of charts with exchange rates and by it's nature it cannot be comprehensive. I think including this as an option with the DEALS feature might work though.
If you are using "wounds" to track damage then a character goes down when they have enough wounds that they cannot effectively participate in combat. A character dies when it would make sense for them to die. (decapitated, heart ripped out, stabbed 20 times, bleeding out for three days, when finished off by other characters while knocked out.)
If i am using hitpoints then 0 means dead, full stop, no death saves here.

### Stealth
At some point I though spot checks were unnecessary. AT THE ITME i was fine with players rolling spot checks for info anyway if they were stuck in a roleplaying situation.
In previous versions I defined words for describing stealth scenes. Hider and Seeker were prevalent. This language sounds dumb. the concept might be sound though. observer? stealther? "to remain hidden a character..." "to detect a hidden character..." "the hidden character..." "the ?seeking/observing? character..."

#### there are some good concepts for stealth here
tl;dr definition, partial stealth, entering and joining from stealth, acting from stealth can cause alert or detection
***
Stealth is where a character hides themselves from other characters. This can be accomplished with magic as well as cunning.
Full stealth is where no one knows where a character is except that character’s allies. Entering a chase or combat from full stealth grants 10 bonus initiative.
Partial stealth is being hidden relative to some characters but visible to others. Entering a chase or combat from partial stealth grants 5 bonus initiative.
Attempting to enter stealth from a chase or combat costs an action, a stealth check, and somewhere to hide.
To stay hidden whilst doing something that could potentially reveal his or her location a character should roll additional stealth checks.

### initiative and turn order
in the past i have noticed some things. first if initiative doesn't just go around the table (counter)clockwise it takes way longer. second, sometimes you can't just go around the table (like when playing online) so Tabula should still have a way to roll initiative regardless or IRL conditions.
So there are a few ways to do initiative. There is the usual D&D way where everyone rolls, gets a number, and then goes in order. This is a lot of work to maintain. VTM had celerity which gave characters additional turns at then end of the round. This did an excellent job of representing superhuman speed but it was OP as shit and could make players without it feel useless. then there is shadowrun initiative which was a lot of sense. essentially players rolled for initiative like normal but you subtracted initiative to take actions until everyone was out and then started a new round. I think the exalted system is probably the best system for my purposes. It can support characters that are dramatically faster than others and it doesn't require an undue ammount of bookkeeping. basically each character has an action delay and the dm calls our the current world initiative. you get to act (all of your actions refresh) once your cooldown is up. I don't remember how initial initiative order was picked. I suppose I could go take a look at an exalted book or make my own.

### problem: speed
when characters are exceptionally fast this is not represented well in the action economy. it might be good to assume characters are always roughly the same speed.

### problem: size -> force
a towering behemoth should be able to oneshot a lightly armored character with a tree he ripped out of the ground, right? well, how do you represent that in this system? We should probably assume most critters are about the same size OR we can forget the numbers in combat and just use common sense.

### action price table
previously I thought this was a good idea. now i think keeping track of 4 stats during combat in addition to the other shit is insane.
If the timing of an action matters initiative should be rolled.
An action is the same thing as 5 initiative in a combat or a chase.
If the timing doesnt matter disregard the action costs.
Resting costs an action but the character regains 2 SP.
Walking and footwork are free.
Acrobatics or running costs an action and an SP.
Attacking costs an action and an SP.
Dodging or blocking costs an action and an SP.
Counter-attacking costs an action and an SP.
Using magic costs an action and an MP.
Attempting to hide costs an action.
Social interactions cost an action and an MP if they are magic.

### counter-attacking
previously i wanted to implement counterattacking but was having a problem doing it without having a fuckton of timing issues. counter-attack chains were prevalent....
Anyway this is solved with an action economy and a turn delay. you canonly counterattack with reactions, you can only use reactions when it isn't your turn, and you get your reactions back with all your actions when your turn delay is finished.






## storytelling
this should probably be divided int a few separate sections. creating settings, story arcs, the DM screen, etc. are all fairly different topics.
***
maybe a section for common problems and solutions with this system.
DON'T make a section for how to roleplay NPCs.
maybe make a section for creating NPC's? it is worth addressing why there isn't a monster manual at least.
this section is devoted to running a game of this system and providing a DM useful tools for that. a FAQ section might also be a good idea.
tips for running (group) combat quickly.

### creating a story
provide some kind of visual framework like a flowchart for creating episodic stories. scenes should have a few options as to how they can resolve most times.
an alternative method of creating the story is how blood in the snow does it. make sure each scene has a granter and a petitioner. (petitioner wants _something_ from granter). the scene can resolve however it does but it should start with these two elements. I think both were supposed to be PCs. i think the players and possibly the game "referee" are supposed to come up with scenes like this on the fly. this is from blood in the snow.

### creating NPCs
same as PCs but don't spend ALL of their exp immediately. allow them to fudge the numbers and gain skills as needed. maybe create their special skill if they have one immediately.
leveling up NPCs using the elder scrolls style tally marks might be a miserable pain. propose an alternative.

### tables
provide tables that are blank but easy to fill in for _interesting_ random encounters, loot, traps, stores, etc. provide a fillable DM screen too. provide a fillable character sheet too

### worldbuilding
i would like to provide a number of canned settings with Tabula that a group can read through quickly and get started roleplaying in. I would also like to add some kind of framework that when filled in would create similarly usable settings. a settings purpose in this context is only to describe it to the players such that they have a feel for the world and can begin roleplaying in it. it is not intended to be an exhaustive history, species catalog, spellbook, item dump, etc. it should however describe all of these things in minimal detail. what does an average character's flavor look like in this setting? what is common flavor. etc.

### creating maps
i would like to include a short tutorial on creating good maps. perhaps a nice framework to provide a starting point. links to youtube tutorials and tools might also be a good idea here.

### money
I am thinking i want to have a chart somewhere that handles things like store prices and loot by asking the dm to define one unit of currency and then derive all the prices in their world based on some percentage or multiple of this. this would also give the DM a good time to think about what things are available or not and what things are scarce or plentiful and adjust prices and availability accordingly. Talk about money in the doc as AUCs (arbitrary units of currency). really I think this should be a part of the "settings" section.
If i decide to give items a level/numeric value it would make sense to have them be orders of magnitude more and less expensive based on those numbers.







## assertions and assumptions
these are some things i believe to be true or assume will be true such that this game can function. this all should be moved to the intro to the doc or the intro to the storyteller section

### assumptions
I have realized I can't actually make this system without making some assumptions. I think these assumptions will be true for the majority of games this system is used in.
- the people of your setting use money
- characters have to eat; food and lodging is a nice baseline for currency
- the power level of armor and weapons will be roughly equivalent--no lightsabers vs plate mail

## mental (mind control/reading) and social (persuasion) combat
you can only defend if you know you are being attacked. if we have attributes all characters get a check against persuasion. otherwise they don't unless they have a relevant skill.

### parts of roleplaying
combat, stealth, conversation, chases, crafting, using skills... uuh. this section seems like it is going to violate the "don't make your own content rule" of the design doc

#### information in roleplaying
there are a few kinds of info: info freely given to the players by the DM so they can play the game, info the DM hasn't thought about explicitly, and info the DM has thought about that must be earned with a check, and meta info like "that character got a name and a description: must be important".
stealth and lying are both methods characters use to conceal information from other characters.
Should we talk about passive perception values and whatnot? yeah that is a relevant discussion for attributes.
Notably, I classify “lying” as an information hiding skill, similar to “sneaking”, rather than as a persuasion skill.
this is all relevant for determining what rolls mean.
lying: first off you can't detect lying. you can detect if someone is uncomfortable or nervous or whatever and this can tip you off. flesh this bit out while reading Joe Navarro's body language manual. lying definitely cannot be used to convince another character of something but it can be used to convince them that you believe that thing. if you say the sky is red they wont believe you because they can just look up but if you are convincing they might believe you believe that. convincing someone of something that is false is a good time for a nested roll actually. one for the lie. one for the convincing.
i suppose there should be a lying differentiation section. if a character is lying to hide information that information it will be treated much like stealth. if you are attempting to convince a character of something that isn't true then just do a persuasion check modified by the plausibility of the lie. 
stealth: i am basing this bit on stealth games i have played. if you fail a stealth check you arent detected (except maybe on a crit). instead you do something that puts the "seekers" on alert and they start looking for you. if they pass their relevant observation checks THEN you get detected. If you pass your stealth check and the seekers start looking for you anyway then you can be detected if you are detectable. IF you are undetectable you cannot be detected but you can alert the seekers that you are there.
perception: if you go looking for something and you pass the check you find it IF it is there. if you fail the check you get no information either way. you just can't tell. this goes for spot checks, detecting intention in social situations, and searching for something.


### persuasion, social combat, resisting persusasion etc.
this is a good time to mention that when you try to convince a character of something they dont _have_ to be convinced. instead they can thing about it a bit and roll some relevant "resist persuasion" rolls which probably uses __willpower__.

### there should be a "starting the game" or "quick-start" top level section
character creation, group formation, and having the storyteller describe the setting to the players for the player visible stuff. creating the setting and a story arc or two for the storyteller

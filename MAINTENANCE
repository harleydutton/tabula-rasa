This was set using these pages as reference:
https://quartz.jzhao.xyz/setting-up-your-GitHub-repository
https://quartz.jzhao.xyz/hosting

###
to modify site css go to ./quartz/styles/custom.scss and make changes

###
content directory can be set using `npx quartz build [--serve] --directory tabula-rasa`
per this pagehttps://quartz.jzhao.xyz/build
this is useful because it lets obsidian vaults have diffent names
the cost is that I must modify the build command in the cicd

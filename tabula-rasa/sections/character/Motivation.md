  - Motivations

Motivations are what make [[Character|Characters]] interesting and as such, each character must have at least one. This can be anything you like that gets a character out of bed in the morning.

When I was speaking with Ethan about character progression, the concept of terminal motivations came up. Most characters have a reason to begin adventuring, and it might be a good idea to mandate that all characters have a goal which,  once reached, signals the end of their time as an adventurer. This will likely tie into hooks and the storybuilding framework.

Perhaps (at least) one long term and one short term goal?

ideals are the compliment to motivations. motivations are the things a character likes while ideals are things a character dislikes. perhaps fears? ikd, maybe just un-abstract this to "likes" and "dislikes"

This section describes any extended competitive activity within a story where the order of events is relevant. Sword and gun fights certainly fit the mold, sure, but so do a number of other things like horse races, ritual summoning gone wrong, and trying to command a fleet with light-minutes of delay. The order and speed with which characters are allowed to act in this game is based on actions and cooldowns.

The three speeds of scene can be described as [[Conflict]], [[Scene]], and [[Downtime]]

Previously "Minor Action"

Usually some small task will need to occur to make the [[Main Action]] possible. Things like moving into range so you can attack with melee. These will be covered by supporting actions. [[Main Action]]s can be converted to Supporting actions.

---

when choosing actions, the supporting action will not require a roll. sometimes the supporting action will not require a success (moving between zones).

The main action will dictate which skill should be rolled for the check. If you get a partial rather than perfect success, the main action will happen and the supporting action will not. this means the supporting action must be independent of the main action. I think that goes against the spirit of the supporting action though. Maybe I should just let players pick which action is main/supporting and which fails on a partial success?

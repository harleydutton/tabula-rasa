[[Veto]] is where the [[Storyteller]] can shut down things a [[Player]] is trying to put in the [[Story]] or [[World]].

[[What is not allowed]] is a placeholder name for part of the [[World]] that will define what magic, tech, flavor and skills [[Player|Players]] can put on their [[Character|Characters]].

[[Storyteller Discretion]] is a mythical magical substance I haven't defined anywhere but have referenced more than a few times.

the [[Storyteller]] should be able to shut down some shit the [[Player|Players]] are doing while roleplaying.

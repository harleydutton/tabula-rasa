Every timed scene starts with no [[Tick|Ticks]] having passed. As a [[Timed Scene]] progresses the [[Storyteller]] should announce the current tick by counting aloud, one by one. As they count up, it is the responsibility of whomever controls a given [[Character]] to know when their next [[Turn]] is.

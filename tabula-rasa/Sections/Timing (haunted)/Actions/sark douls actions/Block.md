Costs one second, reduces stamina recovery per second by one. Weapons can only block sharp/blunt damage and split the damage between your health and stamina. Shields can block any kind of damage and send ¼ of the damage to health and ¼ to stamina, both reduced by shield upgrade value. If you run out of stamina while blocking you are stunned for 15 seconds and take full damage. Shields can be further improved by giving them a damage type. This will make them send 0 damage to health. On successful melee block, increase the attacker’s stun by time-and-a-half rounded down.

If you want to stab a bitch that tried to stab you, you must consume your major action and your reaction.

previously i wanted to implement counterattacking but was having a problem doing it without having a fuckton of timing issues. counter-attack chains were prevalent....
Anyway this is solved with an action economy and a turn delay. you canonly counterattack with reactions, you can only use reactions when it isn't your turn, and you get your reactions back with all your actions when your turn delay is finished.

this should use a [[Reaction]] and a [[Main Action]]

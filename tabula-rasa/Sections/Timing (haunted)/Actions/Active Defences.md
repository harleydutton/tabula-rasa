There are a few options foractive defences
1. roll a check for the [[Attribute]] that would be damaged and either
	1. treat it as an opposed check and subtract successes
	2. treat it as a dodge and negate the attack
2. roll a check with a skill and probably increase the difficulty
	1. treat it as an opposed check and subtract successes
	2. treat it as a dodge and negate the attack

**Numeric active defenses make sense. These are skills. These are things you can DO. I use my swordfighting skill to parry the incoming attack.**

This section got simpler with the inclusion of [[Oppose|Opposed Check]]s. I think this section is still necessary to lay out defensive options in combat though

~~Consider~~ having defences be an attribute with exponential price scaling, some effect on incoming attacks:
- ~~reduce damage; can't, damage is get flavor or don't~~
- ~~chance to avoid damage: this is dodging~~
- ~~I don't want an armor stat for every [[big Health]]~~
- **could roll "defences" to reduce attacker MOS**
- ~~it could be an additional health pool for all 4 attributes? this doesn't really make sense.~~

- [[Active Defenses]] should live in the [[Actions]] section of [[Timed Scene]] and have something to do with [[Reaction]]

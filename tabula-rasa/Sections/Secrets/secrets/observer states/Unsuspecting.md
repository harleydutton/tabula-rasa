Oblivious is a state for the guard and represents that the guard does not know the hidden information and doesn't even know it exists. This is the default state for every character. At any time a player can announce that their character is suspicious and begin being treated that way. NPCs typically need a reason to become suspicious.

When the thief wants to hide info or change hidden info, if there is a guard who could detect them, they need to pass a relevant check. `Lying`, `stealth`, `disguise`, `traps`, `pickpocket`, etc. are skills they might use.

> Actions to hide information: Lying, moving silently, putting on a disguise, world a trap, picking a pocket, etc.

A character is oblivious when they neither know the secret not know of it's existence. If a [[Conflict|conflict]] begins any oblivious characters will be given some form of penalty like an increase to initiative and or have their actions put on cooldown. Most characters are oblivious of most secrets.

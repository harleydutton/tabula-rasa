there are a few different levels of privacy that will affect an observer's awareness level (unsuspecting, suspicious, and aware):
- in public - anything goes in public. tell lies, do crime, wear a disguise. nobody is specifically looking to catch you.
- authorized worlds - in an authorized world, you might not know everything about the world but you should be able to figure out whether or not something is out of the ordinary pretty easily. Do you have your papers, are you dressed right, etc.
- in private - in private you should know everything about what is going on in your surroundings and anything odd would be cause for suspicion
- alone - I don't think this one has anything useful to teach me. There should be nothing, therefore everything is cause for alarm.

After writing all of this out this seems to be more of a difficulty modifier for sneaks than anything else. moving to the storyteller section.

there should maybe be a chance for things to happen while traveling?
time taken (fatigue gained/lost, resources gained/used, healing), distance traveled
time vs distance traveled
fatigue makes the ratio worse
sneaking makes the ratio worse
being hurt makes the ratio worse
carrying too much makes the ratio worse

I don't think I want to link bad stuff to travel specifically but I might leave it as an input to some of the random tables in the toolkit section. Speaking of, this section should be handled with a table generated by the toolkit section.

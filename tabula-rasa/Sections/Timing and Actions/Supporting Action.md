Supporting action is a second, subservient action you get to help with some other action. You can only use a supporting action when you use your [[Main Action]] or when you or your allies use a [[Reaction]]. This action can be something that requires a check but doesn't have to be. Examples include:
- feinting before making an attack
- changing [[Zone|Zones]] to get in range
- anything else that helps your main action
- anything that helps you or an ally's reaction

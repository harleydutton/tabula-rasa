This is a character's out-of-turn-sequence-interrupt action. All reactions happen immediately after the action they react to. You can use your [[Main Action]] or [[Supporting Action]] along with your reaction if you still have it.

Reactions are actions that characters can use to act out of turn. This is most commonly used for defensive actions. Anytime a character uses their reaction they can make a free defensive action. Acting out of turn to counterattack, defend yourself or another character, or by holding a major action all require a character's reaction. On the subject of ordering, all actions must be able to be reacted to. In addition all reactions occur after the action that caused them.

[[If a Tree Falls|this]] might say something about opposed checks. Are they free for the opposition? do they require a reaction in a timed scenario? this bears thinking about.

I think I want to make it so you can do whatever with a reaction but you can't use it on your turn in order to avoid reaction chains.

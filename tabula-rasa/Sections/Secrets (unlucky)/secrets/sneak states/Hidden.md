Previously "Undetected".

Undetected is a state for the thief's hidden info and represents that the thief has successfully hidden it and that the guard might know it exists but hasn't detected it. When the thief wants to hide info or change hidden info, if there is a guard who could detect them, they need to pass a relevant check. Lying, stealth, disguise, traps, pickpocket, etc. are skills they might use.

Actions to hide information: Lying, moving silently, putting on a disguise, world a trap, picking a pocket, etc.

---

To stay hidden whilst doing something that could potentially reveal them like moving, a character should roll additional stealth checks.

thief states:
hidden, obvious, and maybe detected? is there a point to having a caught/detected state. it conveys no further information I think.
hidden is passing the stealth check
obvious is failing the stealth check
detected is passing the observation check

guard states:
unsuspecting, investigating, and aware
unsuspecting is passing the stealth check
investigating is failing the stealth check
aware is passing the observation check

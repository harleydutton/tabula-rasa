all actions are either covert, overt, or somewhere in between. For those actions in the middle, roll a check with either the [[Main Action]] or [[Supporting Action]] being to keep [[Hidden]]. If that action fails, the [[Sneak]] becomes [[Obvious]]. The storyteller will choose which of these three a given action is.

Covert actions will never make a [[Sneak]] [[Obvious]].
Overt actions will always make a Sneak Obvious.

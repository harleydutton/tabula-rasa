**Passive defenses would be things like armor, things that you are. They would be flavor. It is hard to hurt me with a sword because I am wearing plate mail.**

The previous thought for armor and weapons, was that they would collectively modify the subjective difficulty of the attack roll. Attacking someone in plate armor with a sword would be pretty standard, possibly hard, attacking an armored knight with a lightsaber would be easy. This would also influence the wounds given. **that's this**

It doesn't make sense for passive defenses to be numeric because there is no defined way to interact with the numeric parts of the system without making a check and all checks require actions. **therefore, passive defenses must modify difficulty**

- [[Sections/Hurts (unlucky)/Passive Defences]] should probably live in ~~the [[Negative Statuses]] or damage section.~~ some section related check difficulty tailored specifically to combat. Maybe the [[Difficulty]] section should specifically call out this section?

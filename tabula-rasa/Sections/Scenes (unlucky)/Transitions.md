Feel tree to maintain or drop initiative as you switch between chases, combats, and stealth scenes. Use logic to determine when it appropriate to switch between these and when to roll and drop initiative. Characters that start a combat or chase should go first. Characters need to be hidden if they want to start a stealth scene. Any of these can transition into any of the others. Chases are just combat with movement instead of fighting. Initiative for chases and combats works the same.

The combat (timing) section needs to handle this stuff. This doesn't really need to be a note so much as a contract/system declaration. I'm going to move it to the scene's section for now because it touches on a bunch of stuff and is polluting the timing section RN. eventually this should be deleted. DELETE ME. DELETEME.

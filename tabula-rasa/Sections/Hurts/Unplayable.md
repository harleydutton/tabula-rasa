A character becomes unplayable in some way after they accumulate more:
- [[Wounds]] than [[Body]]
- [[Curses]] than [[Spirit]]
- [[Mental Illnesses]] than [[Mind]]
- [[Bad Reputation]] than [[Presence]]

This can mean they have died, gone insane, been possessed, gone to prison, or anything else that seems appropriate for the circumstances under which they gain their final negative [[Negative Statuses|Negative Status]]. This is a good time to make a new character unless your [[Storyteller]] says otherwise.

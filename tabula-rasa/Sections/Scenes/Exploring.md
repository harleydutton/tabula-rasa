I saw a video recently where some guy explained that he wanted and had more codified rules for exploring than D&D has.

D&D:
1. DM describes environment
2. Player describes what they want to do
3. DM narrates result

I happen to agree that these are shit rules. These are the guy's rules:
- describe the environment and give out a number of pieces of **landmark information** equal to the number of players. This lets each player start fucking with one piece of information.
- When the **landmark information** is interacted with provide **hidden information** and have the player roll a check. On a successful check have players learn **secret information**
- This can be represented in notes as "landmark information sentence" --> "hidden information sentence"

I think this is a huge step in the right direction but I'm concerned there isn't much of a linguistic or actual distinction between hidden and secret information. I might collapse those into one thing.

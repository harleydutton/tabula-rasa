Many times, players will try to create skills that are much too broad in scope. Less frequently, players will make skills that are too narrow in scope. Loosely speaking scope represents the percentage of situations a skill can apply to. An example of a skill that is too broad is magic as you can do anything you want with it. A skill that is too narrow would be death curse as it can only be used to kill someone. Somewhere in between we find the skill death magic which has many applications but not infinitely many. It has a specific domain in which it is useful. Storytellers should specifically look out for skills that are too broad during character creation and veto them.

A common problem with [[Skills]] is that I have a hard time defining how big they should be in general. Should a character that wants to blast some fuckers take `fireball`, `fire magic`, or `elemental magic`? The [[Spirit]] [[Attribute]] is roughly equivalent to `magic` which represents the upper bound of scope.

I think presenty I want to say that skills must take the lowest possible scope available to accoplish the thing. Sailing would be a problematic exception though.

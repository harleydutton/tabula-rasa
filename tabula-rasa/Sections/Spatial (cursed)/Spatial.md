Spatial is a placeholder name for the idea that distance, adjacency, AOE, LOS, movement, range, and travel, should all be handled in the same section with orthogonal rules. This would probably require a few more variables on the world sheet to implement like "standard movement distance = zone size" and "distance per day of travel" I would probably have something like little/big zones for combat/travel respectively.

The relationships between characters are almost as important to drama as a character's motivations. Each player character should have a relationship with each other player character and each character should want something from each other character that they cannot have. These things should be dramatically important. This can be done with group character creation. If a character is replaced odd numbered characters get to define their relationship to the new character and for even numbered characters the new character gets to define their relationship to them.

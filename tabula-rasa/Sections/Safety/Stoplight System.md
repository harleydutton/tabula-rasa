One method of maintaining a safe game is to allow everyone--[[Player|Players]] and [[Storyteller]]--to call out "yellow" or "red" if they are uncomfortable with the roleplay happening at the table. Calling out "yellow" means "We are getting close to things I find uncomfortable."  Calling out "red" means "This needs to stop or I will have to leave." When this happens take a break from the game and make sure people are okay. Calling out "green?" and "green" is largely unnecessary but it can be useful shorthand for making sure people are okay after someone has used one of the other colors.

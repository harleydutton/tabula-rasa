This is an [[Check Modifier]] that removes defenses from a character. I don't think I will be using this presently as there aren't any [[Passive and Active Defenses]] to strip right now.

now that I have an idea what [[Passive and Active Defenses]] would look like, I think it might be reasonable to strip the passive ones. Flavor can certainly be added or removed from a character that causes those defenses to dissapear.

On the other hand, active defenses cannot be directly removed, though they are inherently limited by actions and timing. [[Wounds]]/[[Negative Statuses|Negative Status]] should not be removing dice from a character's check pool because the player should remain in full control of that dice pool via the [[Check Design Philosophy]]. Flavor/wounds/damage could be added to a character to make their active defenses check more difficult though.

I think this is probably most similar to the [[Disable]] idea that got rolled into [[Main Action]]. I will include "removing passive defenses i.e. armor which would increase difficulty to hit" as one of the things main action is good for. rejected.

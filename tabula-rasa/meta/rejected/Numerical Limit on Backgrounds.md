If I cannot figure out how to balance backgrounds, then I will put a numeric limit on them:
- a flat limit of 5 or 10 or so
- a scaling limit of 1 per 5 or 10 [[Experience]] or so
- an experience cost of 3 or 5 or so

I dislike this on principle but it is an option

I still dislike this and I will find a way around it. Rejected.

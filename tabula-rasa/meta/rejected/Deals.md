At character creation you may have noticed that there is no way to modify action delay. There is also no way to get any special racial abilities. There is also no way to become rich and famous. Etc. The point is you have to talk to the storyteller when you are creating your character, ask for the things you want, and represent them as flavor. Sometimes the things you want are OP as shit and the DM will want to keep your character in line by raising the cost above the normal for what you are asking for. Want to be super fast? Have -2 action delay by being a vampire (instead death by sunlight). Want to be big enough you can throw cars? Become an Ent for +3 action delay and a vulnerability to fire. Perhaps you can be a world famous boxer if you also have some gambling debts. The point is, talk to your DM and work it out. Sometimes it is appropriate to add a deal to the setting such that it is available to all players and NPCs.

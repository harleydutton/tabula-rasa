Major purchases are very similar to minor purchases except that they are worth more. Typically, to obtain a major purchase, you will have to give the storyteller a hook for your character or give up a boon. The major purchase flavor can be used to pay for things in the "major" column of the world's store. Leadership of an organization, elite training, property, and spaceships are all roughly the same value as the flavor major purchase. Furthermore, major purchases can also be used to pay off hooks or purchase new boons.

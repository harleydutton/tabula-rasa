### advantages and disadvantages
this looks like it came from the star wars RP system?
anyway it looks interesting. I cannot tell if it is for combat or all checks or what.
> As a part of any action a character may attempt to create an advantage for themselves. If the action succeeds whomever is controlling the character gets to describe the advantage they create.

Inversely an advantage might mean that the characterâ€™s opponents have to roll more dice on skill checks, get fewer dice on their damage rolls, or lose initiative.

This sounds like it could make for an interesting [[Check Modifier]]. not doing these anymore.

This is implicitly built into the game. Building it into the game explicitly would change the system where the player modifies check pass rate by leveling up and storyteller modifies it with difficulty. rejected.

Defensive actions are those that characters do to avoid the bad flavor that comes with an attack. Commonly this means blocking, dodging, parrying, etc. Uncommonly this means counterattacking to remove a threat before it can hurt you, or jumping in front of an attack for another character.

Dodge should be the opposition to to-hit rolls. think about armor coverage vs armor hardness. i also have the idea that the only way to avoid damage that has independently passed the to-hit stage is to use a reaction to dodge.
I like the notion that dodging should require a reaction. At storyteller discretion dodging some things might take a reaction and then some. I would say that to "dodge" an explosion you need to get out of it and that would require a move action as well.

Some defensive actions require a character to get out of the way to avoid an attack. In these cases character will need to spend a movement action in addition to a reaction to make a defensive action.

I think this section is the more generic version of a dodge action. Defensive actions should require [[Reaction]] and possibly also a [[Supporting Action]]

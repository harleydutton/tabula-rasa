There isn't a built in skill for gathering information in this system. it might make sense to make this a gathering check, which would make sense to be an interact action. On the other hand looking around seems like it should be a free action. I guess it depends on how close you are looking.

I think this makes the most sense as a supporting action really. rejected.

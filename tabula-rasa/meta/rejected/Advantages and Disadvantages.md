As an action character may attempt to create an advantage for themselves or a disadvantage for another character. If the action succeeds whomever is controlling the character gets to describe the advantage they create. If the storyteller finds it reasonable it happens. If not, don’t waste time arguing, just move on.

An advantage can also take the form of having to roll fewer dice on a skill check in the future, or a bonus to initiative. Inversely an advantage might mean that the character’s opponents have to roll more dice on skill checks, get fewer dice on their damage rolls, or lose initiative.

I can't tell if this wants to be [[Difficulty]] or [[Disable]]. Either way, those sections handle this functionality better. rejected.

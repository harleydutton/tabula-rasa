basically a [[Motivation]]
gives the storyteller a way to pull you deeper into the story and do some character focused stuff rather than plot focused stuff

**Hooks** are a special piece of flavor that the storyteller can use to interact specifically with your character to create tension within the story. Adding a hook to your character is the typical way to go about getting a [[Boon]] and it also integrates your character into the story a little better most times. A hook can be a love interest, an enemy, a debt, a cause, a disability, and much more. When you would like to add a hook to your character you must first discuss it with your storyteller and if they agree to let you take the hook you also get a boon. Hooks are distinct from motivations in that they don't always come from within e.g. being #17 on the FBI most wanted list.

Character hooks, or hooks for short, are a way to get boons and give the storyteller a way to pull you further into the story. A hook is anything that allows the storyteller to motivate your character specifically. A hook can be a love interest, an enemy, a debt, a cause, a disability, and much more.

Does This doesn't strictly have to be a [[Motivation]] or interesting [[Background]].
character motivation is less important than knowing how to engage a player. The player who just wants to hit stuff in combat doesn't really need a motivation, they need stuff to hit. This is the real purpose of [[Hooks]] I think. (Obviously the players that wants an RP in to the game should have that. This is the softest possible shit rules-wise)

- tracking number of [[Hooks]] might be interesting. if they are separated out this is done implicitly and I am thinking about removing rewards/incentives for hooks anyway. won't do presently.

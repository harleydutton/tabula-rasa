Reactions allow you to take your other actions on a tick that is not your own. If you choose to spend any actions non-defensively on a tick that is not your own, you act last on that tick. If multiple players would act last on a tick, break the tie with the [ties](#ties) section.

I think incrementing when your shit comes off cooldown by one can be done whenever you want at no cost. This is probably a [[Free Action]] and it colors how things have to be for [[Entering Combat]]

perhaps this should be mixed with some kind of [[Look around]] action where it costs you 1d6 rather than [[Turn Delay]] ticks and you get some information?

This has been rolled into [[Free Action]]. rejected.

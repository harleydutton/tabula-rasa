There are a few options for active defences
1. roll a check for the [[Attribute]] that would be damaged and either
	1. treat it as an opposed check and subtract successes
	2. treat it as a dodge and negate the attack
2. roll a check with a skill and probably increase the difficulty
	1. treat it as an opposed check and subtract successes
	2. treat it as a dodge and negate the attack

**Numeric active defenses make sense. These are skills. These are things you can DO. I use my swordfighting skill to parry the incoming attack.**

---

This section got simpler with the inclusion of [[Oppose|Opposed Check]]s. I think this section is still necessary to lay out defensive options in combat though

---

~~Consider~~ having defences be an attribute with exponential price scaling, some effect on incoming attacks:
- ~~reduce damage; can't, damage is get flavor or don't~~
- ~~chance to avoid damage: this is dodging~~
- ~~I don't want an armor stat for every [[big Health]]~~
- **could roll "defences" to reduce attacker MOS**
- ~~it could be an additional health pool for all 4 attributes? this doesn't really make sense.~~

- [[Active Defenses]] should live in the [[Actions]] section of [[Timed Scene]] and have something to do with [[Reaction]]

---

Defensive actions are those that characters do to avoid the bad flavor that comes with an attack. Commonly this means blocking, dodging, parrying, etc. Uncommonly this means counterattacking to remove a threat before it can hurt you, or jumping in front of an attack for another character.

---

Dodge should be the opposition to to-hit rolls. think about armor coverage vs armor hardness. i also have the idea that the only way to avoid damage that has independently passed the to-hit stage is to use a reaction to dodge.
I like the notion that dodging should require a reaction. At storyteller discretion dodging some things might take a reaction and then some. I would say that to "dodge" an explosion you need to get out of it and that would require a move action as well.

---

Some defensive actions require a character to get out of the way to avoid an attack. In these cases character will need to spend a movement action in addition to a reaction to make a defensive action.

---

I think this section is the more generic version of a dodge action. Defensive actions should require [[Reaction]] and possibly also a [[Supporting Action]]

---

- round based conflict using action economy. series of opposed checks. synchronous as opposed to async.

I think this means you 

---

Most generically I think this winds up being ~~called Opposed Action and referencing [[Oppose|Opposed Check]].~~ rolled into [[Reaction]]. rejected.

Some systems change the way a world works. The [[Wealth]] system for example makes it impossible to save up any [[Money]]. I like this system, but it doesn't make sense for every world and story. A feature flag system would be a system that lets me toggle and swap multiple, redundant systems depending on what best fits the world. As an example, I would need multiple redundant [[Wealth]] systems in order to accomplish this and a clear way to convey to everyone using it which one is in use.

This would be a formatting decisions. I just had the realization that I should never give any context to the things I link to. All links should be direct.

Wrong:
- "**speed** is leveled up using **experience** on the **quadratic scaling** chart" is wrong and bad because the **quadratic scaling** note already talks about **experience**.
- "the purpose of **speed** is to determine **turn delay** using **default delay** from the **world sheet**" is wrong because **world (sheet)** is completely irrelevant here.
- I'm pretty sure I do this in places but "X from the Y section is also bad"

this would improve maintainability because if things move sections I wouldn't have to update the notes saying one thing is part of another.

This would improve readability? simplicity? something. by conveying the information more directly and with less noise.

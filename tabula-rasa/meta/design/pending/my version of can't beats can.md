Because it affects a number of systems I think it might be a good idea to put in checks that "the last action to be rolled as a success decides what happens" or something similar. This is in the interest of avoiding opposed rolls

- reactions beat actions
- resistance beats persuasion
- seeing beats stealth.

- this hits on [[Oppose]]s and [[Reaction]]s
- something like this might still work but I think i'm going to be using opposed rolls at least some of the time so I might have to reject this. might still be relevant as a generic rule to break ties in the conflict section
- I think better wording would be, you can use a reaction to [[Oppose|Oppose a Check]].

can reactions be reacted to? no is the sane answer
I think this is probably a few different design decisions in a unified field theory shaped trench coat

I have some options if I plan on changing my initiative system.
- initiative (current) and action economy
- attack, feint, parry
- flowchart
- spotlight
- opposed rolls
- secretly bid finite resources and compare
- call and response
- pseudorandom (high, med, low chance of success cards--no shuffle)

l think if I want to be able to make changes to the initiative system I will need to decouple it from everything else.

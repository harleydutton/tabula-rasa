It (tabula) will discuss types of stories and provide tools for running/making a variety of them. --the intro

by tools I mean things like a storyteller section that lays out a process for quickly brainstorming tables of things if you are playing a game that needs them. and other similar things that aren't tables. basically an "I can't give you what you need because I don't know what it is but I can teach you how to make it quickly" section

This would be supporting games like the social game or the roam, fight, trade loop game or the continental travel game.

This should be scoped out, codified as a design decision, and paraphrased into the new content section.

types of content creation
- negotiation
	- storyteller creates limits, players new thing for storyteller to add to setting
	- empowers players
	- limit and veto rules make the process faster
		- players must stay in limits
		- vetos require new limits
		- this could get messy if limits are fucky, think about what makes for good/bad limits.
- secret
	- storyteller creates content alone, then reveals it to players when ready
	- maps and npcs and such
	- allowed to cheat to make the process faster
- collaborative
	- players and storyteller brainstorm content together to make content on the fly
	- croudsourceing ideas makes the process faster
	- possibly unnecessary, this is what needs scoped out.

the "new content" folder may need to be split up to accommodate all of these modes.

I wager most of this belongs in the new content creation section of the document

Should I have all the necessary stuff (definitions, mechanics, systems) and then a storyteller and possibly player 'book' in addition or should I roll all that into one? Is this distinction meaningful with the online publishing method?

I have two choose your own adventure start points on [[index|Tabula Rasa]]'s home page. one for the player and one for the storyteller. I think as part of polish I might go through and pick an intended audience for each section and rewrite them to be that way. I could keep track of this using obsidian as either tags, properties, or something else.

motivations have no mechanical effect. as this is the litmus I have been using for if something goes on the character sheet, motivations won't be going on there. I do think they are an important part of a character though so I might make an exception.

for a game that focuses on characters to any real degree, motivations are a critical part of a character's identity and to that end I feel I can justify the space for them on the sheet. That being said, for a meat-grinder combat game it wouldn't make sense to have them. I could see them being a few words or a more complicated backstory type of thing.

are motivations part of backgrounds or part of identity?

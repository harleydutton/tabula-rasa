Some of the design decisions include a new concept. I think I would like to separate those out such that the concept and the decision can be referenced separately. Offenders:
- [[GTA Wanted Meter]]
- h and r block -- the imaginary software that would be required for a system generator
- feature flags -- I think this term only really applies to software engineers and as such it probably makes sense to put it in concepts
	- there are two notes named "feature flags"~

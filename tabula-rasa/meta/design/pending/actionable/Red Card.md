The red card is a way for anyone to indicate that they are uncomfortable with the current roleplay and would like to move on. To use it, silently touch the item designated as the red card. If you are not playing in person saying "red" is an option. In order for this to work it needs to be talked about before it is needed. While you are at it, preemptively mention types of roleplay you would rather avoid and ask your group to do the same.

I'm not 100% sure where this should live. This, descriptions, and intro are all kinda orphans.

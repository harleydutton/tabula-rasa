If I were to decide this was a system generator then the systems a storyteller chose to enable with [[Feature Flags]] would matter a lot in terms of the experience they are creating for their players. 

1. These are some common gameplay loops...
2. And if you were wanting to support one of these experiences, these are the systems you would want to (de)emphasize...
3. For *these* reasons... (not filled in right now)

- combat game loop: explore, fight, loot, sell (combat, encounters, loot)
- social game loop: schedule, meeting, gossip (group character creation, petitioner and granter)
- growth game loop: problem, exclusive choice, growth, time passes (character progression tree, motivations)
- generational game loop: problem, exclusive choice, new generation, world changes
- travel game loop: exclusive choice, travel, encounter, gain/lose resources (travel, resources, motivations)

I have previously decided tabula will not be a system generator or have feature flags. Furthermore, this isn't a decision so much as a concept. If various worlds end up being incompatible with various systems it might be worth explaining this in the storyteller section and suggesting they disable some systems.

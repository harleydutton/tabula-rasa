At one point I had a combat system where each character had 4 resources that would need to be tracked--health, mana, stamina, initiative. That is a lot to keep track of, especially if there are a bunch of NPCs. I am now making it a point to keep the hypothetical logistics simple when designing systems.

Fewer resources is [[Minimal]]

At one point I made this game as realistic as I could. It was terrible for a bunch of reasons and played slowly. Furthermore it was really hard to work on because realism isn't easy to represent in a generic, probably fantastical roleplaying system.

Since then, I have vowed to abstract things in a way that makes the game play well rather than making things realistic at any cost.

This is a decision that will make the game more [[Dramatic]] and [[Minimal]]

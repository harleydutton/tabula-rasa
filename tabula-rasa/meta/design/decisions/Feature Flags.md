Some of my worlds are opinionated. The wealth system for example abstracts wealth to a degree that it is impossible to save up. I like this system, but it doesn't make sense for every story so it should be optional. There should be a more generic wealth system included as well. The world document should have a table that tells players which systems are being used.

This decision supports the pillar of being [[Generic]].

Previously I had the idea of "Flavor" running rampant throughout the system. It was intended to encompass every part of a character that was not highly mechanical like skills and attributes. The problem is that it was too broad and difficult to define.

Since then, I have split what was previously Flavor and is now [[Descriptors]] up into three parts:
1. [[Background]] describe things a [[Character]] is or knows
	- are: wizard, vampire, robot, orc, guardsman, etc.
	- know: common, elvish, name of a demon, calculus, etc.
2. [[Items]] are the things a [[Character]] has
	- money, weapons, armor, tools, consumables, etc.
3. [[Negative Statuses|Negative Statuses]] are things that affect a [[Character]]
	- [[Wounds]], [[Curses]], [[Mental Illnesses]], and [[Bad Reputation]]
	- stun, grappled, prone, wet, drunk, poisoned, possessed, etc.

The GTA wanted meter was an in-game system that would tell you how much "The Law" wanted to shoot you or put you in jail your your actions. Getting caught breaking the law was what made it go up and laying low or leaving town was what made it go down. Once it reached the maximum value the normal gameplay loop was discarded and you instead had to run, hide, or die.

I am implementing similar systems for social and spiritual damage that will ultimately lead to [[Generic Death]] if not dealt with.

The goal of this system is to give the [[Storyteller]] something in between [[Rocks Fall]] and nothing such that they can try and keep their [[Story]] on the rails. It also gives them a way of warning players when their character is getting close to [[Generic Death]]

This decision supports the pillars of being [[Accessible]] and [[Empowering]].

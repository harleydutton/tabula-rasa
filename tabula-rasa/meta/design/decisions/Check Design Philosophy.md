I want checks to have two variables. One that the player controls, one that the storyteller controls. Players will get to control number of dice by leveling up their skills and attributes. The storyteller gets to control the difficulty of each check by setting the subjective difficulty (target number).

This supports the pillars of being [[Simple]] and [[Accessible]]

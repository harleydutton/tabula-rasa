Stories need drama to be interesting and fun. As a game about grout group, improvisational storytelling I want this game to be dramatic. Examples:
- Character motivations and inter-character relationships created in group character creation.
- Creating problems for the player characters is good
- Storyteller should enable players to resolve tension, not resolve it for them.

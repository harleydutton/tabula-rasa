I would like these rules to promote--or at the very least not impede--drama.

These values are similar to the Agile Manifesto where both X and Y are things we want to maximize but if we must choose between them we choose X over Y.
- avoiding TPKs over preventing storyteller from reducing tension
- keeping the story on the rails over resolving PVP tensions.
- player-player roleplay over player-storyteller roleplay

- players roleplaying
- roleplaying character motivations
- avoiding TPKs (everyone going down means at least one will live and at least one will die)
- staying on the rails
- resolving PVP (50% opposed to staying on the rails)
- players making decisions (together?)
- players committing to resolving tension
- storyteller creating/raising tension
- character deaths are dramatic (I don't think there is a way to do this and maintain some level of lethality)
- all scenes/conflicts must create narrative tension for at least one player (not generic, takes away player autonomy, not dungeon crawl friendly)


- Character motivations and inter-character relationships created in group character creation.
- Creating problems for the player characters is good
- Storyteller should enable players to resolve tension, not resolve it for them.

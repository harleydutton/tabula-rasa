Disambiguate the "[[World]] map", battle grid", [[Battlefield]], and "theater of mind."

It might be useful to tackle the disambiguation of "movement" and "travel" at the same time.

"distance", "range bands", "zones", "line of sight", "cover", "rough terrain" and the rest probably need to be addressed.

From [[Travel (old)]] which I am in the process of untangling from [[Scene|Scenes]].

Worldbuilding is the process of creating a fictional [[World]] in which to tell stories and roleplay characters. Developing a history, culture, ecology, and any number of other [[Worldbuilding Elements]] with purpose is key to creating a coherent world. Alternatively, there exists plenty of [[Source Material]] like books, films, and games already with worlds you can use. This game also expects [[Player|Players]] to create portions of the world over time.

In either case, you will need to fill out a [[World Sheet]] with sensible values. This is a guide for doing so:

- [[Tick Length]] is how long you want turns of conflict to take. For a sword or gun fight a second is a reasonable value. This should be increased for vehicle and social combat.
- [[Default Delay]] represents the variance between character speed. A value of 11 is reasonable for most games and makes the math easy. This should be increased if you want characters to have more similar turn lengths.
- [[Domain]] is what portion of the world a world sheet represents. If you are drawing from source material this should already be defined. Otherwise, choose area you plan on describing to your players when you start your story and expand it or create new world sheets for new areas as needed.
- The [[Experience Tracker|Group Experience]] value on the experience tracker is the starting [[Experience]] that will be available at character creation. I recommend 50 for characters of moderate competence.
- The [[Store]] is a list of goods and [[Prices]] for things that can be bought and sold within the world. To start, write out a list of a bunch of purchasable things that exist in the world. Once you have a decent list, begin pricing them based the how available they should be.
- The list of [[Available Skills]] should be populated with answers to the question "What do people in this world **do** to overcome adversity?" Different kinds of fighting, socializing, academics, and resource gathering are usually the first things you should look at when creating [[Skills]].
- The list of [[Available Backgrounds]] should be populated with answers to the question "What **are** people in this world?" Professions and species are usually the first things you should look at when creating [[Background|Backgrounds]].

Things you might want to limit are as follows: This might be things like resurrection, undodgeable attack actions, and fast, long-range communications.

mind control, personal flight, invisibility, instant+long-range comms, undodgeable attacks like guns, AoE attacks like explosions, teleportation, resurrection, mind reading, lie detecting, minions, crafting, agelessness, super strength/speed, letters of credit, damage immunities, incoporeality/being a ghost, money as a superpower.

[[Limits]] is going to be a part of the [[World Sheet]] so this section will need some examples.

  - Negotiate New Content

This is where the [[Player]] wants some [[Content]] added to the [[World]] that is within the [[Limits]] so they go talk to the storyteller about it, some compromises are made, everyone is unhappy because it's a good compromise, and *something* gets added to the world doc.

It is the intent of this system that you can play what you want. Players can speak with the storyteller and propose things to be added to the world. If you want to play a cat-man samurai talk to the storyteller about adding cat-men to the world and if samurai need special skills or tools to be relevant, propose those too. If the storyteller agrees, "Boom!", you can play what you want.

If you want to play a cat-man samurai, talk to the storyteller about adding cat-men to the world and if samurai need special skills or flavor–probably equipment in this instance–to be relevant, propose those too. If the storyteller has no objections, boom, you can play exactly what you want.

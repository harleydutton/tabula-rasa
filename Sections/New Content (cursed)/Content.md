this should be a list of available skills and flavor (items and the normal kind).
limits should (including hooks) should be marked.

In an abstract sense this section compliments the [[Limits]] section. The world's limits describe what is banned/restricted within the world and most other things are implicitly allowed. Things that actually exist per the player/storyteller are what I would call content. The store is intended more to set the tone, create expectations for what NPCs will be like, and be an example of character parts that will fit into the world. Should this section be a part of Limits? Flavor store, skill store, flavor limits, skill limits.

Limits define what is *not* allowed in the [[World]]. Content will describe what *exists* in the world. The remainder, what is allowed but does not exist is covered by [[Skill Creation]] and [[Getting Backgrounds]] and [[Item Creation]], all of which can probably be made more general with [[New Content Negotiation]]
- [[Background|Backgrounds]]
- [[Skills]]
- [[Store]]

the list of all content created for the world sounds a hell of a lot like something that should be on the world sheet. alternatively, the idea that there should be a list should be dropped.

If you create a skill with appropriate scope that is just too powerful for the world or story (most magic skills) your storyteller may inflict a few limiting factors upon the skill you have proposed for your character.

@Storyteller: A few good limiting factors are timing restrictions (requires multiple turns in combat, cannot be done in combat, takes multiple days, etc.), resource costs (add a mana bar, minor purchases, major purchases, etc.), context restrictions (must have line of sight, must have eye contact, must be touching the target, must have a piece of the target, etc.), and cooldowns (AUTs or turns, once per combat, once per day, refreshes randomly, etc.). If you cannot balance a skill, veto it.

The limits section should be a thing players can read and get up to speed with regards to what is mechanically acceptable within the game. This should be created by the storyteller with help from this and the storyteller sections. It should include what kinds of skills and flavor are allowed to be created within the game.

The idea of two forms of two forms of limits--disallowing and balancing--is one I have had for a while apparently but haven't made rules or disambiguation for.

The above is a reminder that I will probably want limits to happen in three ways:
- storyteller defines initial ~~limits~~ restrictions (which possibly involve limits)
- storyteller adds ~~limit~~ restriction after vetoing something
- storyteller adds a limit to a skill while it is being made to balance it

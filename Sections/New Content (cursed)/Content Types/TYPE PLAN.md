It feels like maybe I shouldn't have all four of:
- [[Background Creation Negotiation]]
- [[Item Creation and Pricing]]
~~- [[Skill Types]]~~
- [[Skill Creation]]

I probably should talk about content and it should happen in the [[Content]] note where I link to the [[Descriptors]], [[Skills|Skill]], [[Items|Item]], [[Background|Backgrounds]],

This is intended to disambiguate [[Scope]] and "power". How many things a skill can do is not the game as how big those things are. This only deals with how big they are. Can I fireball the city? Spatial may be useful for this. For things that don't use space I may need to come up with other measures. Letting characters fuck around with absolute zero seems like a fast way to change the tone/theme of the game.

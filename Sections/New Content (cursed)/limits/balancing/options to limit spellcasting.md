~~These are options I have thought up to limit the power of wizards in my system.
~~
- magic skills are a single modifiable skill like fire-ball, not an entire school of related skills
- casting accumulates temporary negative [[Negative Statuses]]
- probably more in [[Limits]]
- roll the event die and get [[Negative Statuses]] on a 1. [[The Event Die]]

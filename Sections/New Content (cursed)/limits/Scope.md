Many times, players will try to create skills that are much too broad in scope. Less frequently, players will make skills that are too narrow in scope. Loosely speaking scope represents the percentage of situations a skill can apply to. An example of a skill that is too broad is magic as you can do anything you want with it. A skill that is too narrow would be death curse as it can only be used to kill someone. Somewhere in between we find the skill death magic which has many applications but not infinitely many. It has a specific domain in which it is useful. Storytellers should specifically look out for skills that are too broad during character creation and veto them.

A common problem with [[Skills]] is that I have a hard time defining how big they should be in general. Should a character that wants to blast some fuckers take `fireball`, `fire magic`, or `elemental magic`? The [[Spirit]] [[Attribute]] is roughly equivalent to `magic` which represents the upper bound of scope.

I think presenty I want to say that skills must take the lowest possible scope available to accoplish the thing. Sailing would be a problematic exception though.

### problems with previous iterations of "players are allowed to create their own skills"
tl;dr players could make skills that were vague and applied to every scenario and then max them.
- using incredibly broad skills that apply to every scenario. "social graces" applies to every social situation, provides little character depth, and makes it so a player can use the dice to walk all over the game.

A character might know “knots” because they know the skill “sailing” and that’s fine even though the character is getting a lot of skills for free under the umbrella-skill of “sailing”. 
On the other hand I encouraged THIS at one point.
perhaps worlds should include a list of default/common skills?
there is something of a goldilocks zone for skill scope. Magic is too broat, fireball is too narrow, but fire magic is just right.

With regards to magic, I think my most recent thought is fireball is probably the appropriate scope, not fire magic. Spirit == magic in this canonical scope example (magic > fire magic > fireball)

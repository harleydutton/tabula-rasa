- new content negotiation
	- define content
		- backgrounds/descriptors
		- skills
		- items
	- limits and restrictions
		- limits - things added to proposed content to balance it
		- restrictions - things you can't propose (on world sheet)
		- things
			- scope
			- theme
			- tone
			- uniqueness
			- cooldown
			- secondary resources
			- risk of wounds
	- proposal (players look at restrictions, cook up something not disallowed, and tells the storyteller about it)
		- proposal should begin with player looking at restrictions
		- second step should be adding a limit or two to the proposal
		- veto (turn down proposal and refer player to existing limit or add new limit)
		- accept and add to world sheet
		- add limits to skill, then add to the world sheet

The below is a reminder that I will probably want limits/restrictions to happen in three ways:
- storyteller defines initial ~~limits~~ restrictions (which possibly involve limits)
- storyteller adds ~~limit~~ restriction after vetoing something
- storyteller adds a limit to a skill while it is being made to balance it

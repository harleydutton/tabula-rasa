- Restrictions are the things that you aren't allowed to propose adding to the game.
- There should be a restrictions list on the world sheet.

- Restrictions can involve limits like "magic skills will have a secondary resource and a risk of bad."
- some limits might not be restrictions and I may have to go through and sort those

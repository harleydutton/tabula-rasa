- negotiation
	- storyteller creates limits, players new thing for storyteller to add to world
	- empowers players
	â€‹- limit and veto rules make the process faster
		- players must stay in limits
		- vetos require new limits
		- this could get messy if limits are fucky, think about what makes for good/bad limits.

- new content negotiation
	- limits
		- scope
		- theme
		- tone

  - Negotiate New Content
---
This is where a [[Player]] wants some [[Content]] added to the [[World]] that doesn't violate any of the existing [[Restriction|Restrictions]] so they go talk to the storyteller about it, some compromises are made, everyone is unhappy because it's a good compromise, and *something* gets added to the world doc.

---

It is the intent of this system that you can play what you want. Players can speak with the storyteller and propose things to be added to the world. If you want to play a cat-man samurai, talk to the storyteller about adding cat-men to the world and if samurai need special skills or flavor–probably equipment in this instance–to be relevant, propose those too. If the storyteller has no objections, boom, you can play exactly what you want.

---

The [[Storyteller]] has three options upon receiving a proposal. They can accept, add additional limits and accept, or [[Veto]] the proposal.


---

okay, lets describe the process

1. proposal
	1. think up new content (skill, item, background)
	2. check restrictions
	3. add limits
2. give to storyteller
	1. accept
		1. no changes
		2. added to world sheet
	2. tweak
		1. add limits to content in the proposal
		2. accept
		3. add to the world sheet
	3. veto
		1. content is rejected
		2. storyteller adds new restriction to the world sheet

---

you can't play absolutely anything you want in most cases but this negotiation framework aims to help players play what they want without driving the storyteller crazy.

---

don't build an entire character without checking in with the storyteller. It feels very bad in a [[Mother May I]] sort of way to build an entire character based on some set of restrictions and have the storyteller [[Veto]] some core concept of your character. Build characters top down with a lot of communication with the storyteller.

---

The below is a reminder that I will probably want limits/restrictions to happen in three ways:
- storyteller defines initial ~~limits~~ restrictions (which possibly involve limits)
- storyteller adds ~~limit~~ restriction after vetoing something
- storyteller adds a limit to a skill while it is being made to balance it

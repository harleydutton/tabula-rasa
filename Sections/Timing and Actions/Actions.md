Actions are the sorts of things [[Character|Characters]] can do in [[Timed Scene|Timed Scenes]]. Typically characters get a [[Main Action]], [[Supporting Action]], and [[Reaction]] when it is their [[Turn]] and once used, those actions cannot be used again until their next turn. Additionally, [[Free Action|Free Actions]] can be used at any time without limit.

Character creation is simple: Get the [[World Sheet]] from your [[Storyteller]], then fill out a [[Character Sheet]] with the following in no particular order:
- check [[Limit]] and [[New Content Negotiation|Negotiate New Content]] for [[Skills]], [[Background|Backgrounds]], and [[Items]] you want that aren't on the [[World Sheet]]
- spend [[Sections/Character/Experience]] on [[Attribute|Attributes]] and [[Skills]]
- take some [[Items]] from the [[Store]]

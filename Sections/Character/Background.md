Backgrounds are something a [[Character]] is or something they know. Additionally if a background lets you do something and that action has a chance to fail, that is a [[Skills]], not a background: A fluent French speaker cannot fail to speak French, however a swordsman can absolutely fail to put a sword in somebody.

Unlike most [[Descriptors]], backgrounds can be a collection of a bunch of different things:
> - vampire
> 	- has fangs and drinks blood
> 	- no pulse and pale skin
> 	- ignites in sunlight
> 	- pretty and strong

With this in mind, backgrounds should not be monochromatically good. If you are a sailor and an expert at all things related to boats this should come with explicit trade-offs like not being able to read or missing some limbs. This is the part of backgrounds that usually requires [[New Content Negotiation]], even after looking at the world's [[Limits]].

Mechanically, like all descriptors, backgrounds will modify the [[Difficulty]] of [[Checks]] to which they apply.

All backgrounds should be added to the [[World Sheet]] when complete.

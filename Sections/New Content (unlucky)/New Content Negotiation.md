  - Negotiate New Content

This page details a process for creating new [[Content]]. When a [[Player]] wants to add something to the [[World]] they will always have to communicate with the [[Storyteller]] to make this happen. Below is a way to organize that conversation to help the storyteller clearly communicate what is and isn't allowed in the world and give the player the best possible chance to play the [[Character]] they are imagining.

1. A player creates a proposal
	1. Contains one piece of new content
	2. Check that it does not violate anything on the [[Restrictions List]]
	3. Add [[Limit|Limits]]
2. The storyteller reviews the proposal
	1. Accept proposal "as is" and add the content it describes to the [[World Sheet]]
	2. Add more limits to the content until satisfied, then add it to the world sheet
	3. [[Veto]] the proposed content

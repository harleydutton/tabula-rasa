If you give out enough [[Sections/Character/Experience]] and set your world's [[Default Delay]] low enough you may experience the problem where some enterprising player dumps all of their experience into [[Speed]], potentially allowing them to reach a negative speed value. If this happens, the combat system breaks. To solve this problem increase [[Default Delay]] until their speed is 0. To prevent this problem, the maximum experience you should ever give is (n(n+1)(2n+1))/6 where n is [[Default Delay]].

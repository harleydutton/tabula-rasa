At the end of each session, players will receive [[Sections/Character/Experience]] based on a rubric made by the [[Storyteller]]. This rubric should consist of a handful yes-no questions regarding what a player did in the session. For each question a [[Player]] answers "yes" to they get one experience. The rubric itself should be visible to players and should therefore be on the [[World Sheet]].

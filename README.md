# Tabula-Rasa
## About
This README is not intended to be part of Tabula Rasa. Instead it is a meta-document for tracking design, philosophy, formatting, and tasks. Created by Harley Dutton.

### From the Intro:
Tabula Rasa is a worldbuilding framework and a rules-light, generic roleplaying game that lets players create their own skills.

The worldbuilding framework produces a Setting. Settings are short, standardized, and easily sharable descriptions of a single place within a world. The intent is that Settings can be used to quickly understand a part of the world such that a player can create a Character or the Storyteller can create an Adventure.

The roleplaying system is generic so it will work with any Setting produced by the worldbuilding framework. The rules are minimal meaning you and your group should be able to create any character imaginable within the setting and start playing very quickly!

## Philosophy
- Plays fast
- Players make skills
- generic
- low entry barrier
- short
- not preachy
- fun > balance/realism
- avoid math/book-keeping
- dry using links; otherwise printable
- avoid charts/tables (in the actual doc)

### Outstanding problems
THE RELATED SKILLS PROBLEM: how do you take new skills or make new characters in the system where skills level up independently? What if a character wants a skill similar to one of their existing skills but different? How do you make new characters or replacements when one dies in game? Elder scrolls leveling is messy...

THE CRAFTING PROBLEM: Either items have numbers (NO) or magnitude of success has no bearing on the item being created. This is okay if the player creating the item is specific about what they want and this modifies the difficulty.

THE WOUNDS AND DEATH PROBLEM: If we are saying MoS on attack rolls means you get to inflict bad flavor when does a character die? When they have a certain number of bad flavors? Who determines what flavor can be added to a character? Perhaps we should just have health? How do you determine when a character has accumulated enough flavor that they are unconscious or dead? This can probably be solved by saying "no giving immediately lethal flavor", "unconscious/downed characters can be coup de gra'ed", and adding a subjective system for when a character has a shit-pile of wounds they should probably go down. Not having source material makes combat messy... When moving is non-trivial (on the trivial, easy, normal, hard, impossible subjective check difficulty scale) a character is downed. When attacking is impossible a character can be considered impotent and initiative can be dropped.


## To-Do
- merge the stealth and lying sections. should become "deception and perception"
- add description to top level section "stealth and perception"
- CC
  - reduce the "character creation" section and add sections to "character" (really just move them and refine both)
  - redo the "adding skills to the setting" section in CC
  - change character sheet such that it has "current AD" and "initial AD"
  - remove duplicate subsections in skills section
- images
  - add an example image/table for the store
  - add an example image for a whole setting
- feedback
  - which terms need to go in the glossary. does the glossary need to exist?
  - does the attacking section need subsections?
  - where do we need example images, charts, or descriptions?
- formatting
  - format things using legend
  - make sure all formatting options appearing in the legend can be in a list so the legend looks less crazy and random.
  - put headings in title case
- polish
  - add grammar check plugin
  - make the images non-shit
  - export as PDF


## Legend
examples of specific skills and flavor will be `monospace` in-line
> larger examples will be quoted and appear under the relevant section with no header.

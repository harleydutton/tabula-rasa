# Introduction
Tabula Rasa is a worldbuilding framework and a rules-light, generic roleplaying game that lets players create their own skills.

The worldbuilding framework produces a Setting. Settings are short, standardized, and easily sharable descriptions of a single place within a world. The intent is that Settings can be used to quickly understand a part of the world such that a player can create a Character or the Storyteller can create an Adventure.

The roleplaying system is generic so it will work with any Setting produced by the worldbuilding framework. The rules are minimal meaning you and your group should be able to create any character imaginable within the setting and start playing very quickly!

## getting started
The storyteller should go take a look at the setting section and make sure they understand settings. Then the storyteller will need to make a setting or find one online.
The players should go take a look at character creation and begin creating characters using the setting your storyteller has provided you with.

## How to Play (maybe remove this section or merge with something?)
Tabula Rasa is a roleplaying game. Experienced role-players can now proceed to the [Checks](#checks) section. For everyone else, roleplaying is a form of collaborative, improvisational storytelling.

One person, the storyteller, will present a world and a story. The storyteller can use a world, or setting, of their own design or one from popular media. The [setting](#setting) section has more details on what you can expect from this fictitious world. The storyteller is also responsible for giving the world life. They plan out scenes between players and NPCs, provide the decisions and voice acting for NPCs, and narrate events in the world to drive the story they have planned.

The rest of the people in a roleplaying game are players. Usually, players will create a character for the game. See the [character_creation](#character-creation) section for help with this. Once a player has a character, they will provide voice acting, motivations, and personality for the character in addition to controlling their actions within the fictitious realm of the story.

A night of roleplaying usually lasts anywhere from two to six hours and usually includes a variety of scenes. Exhilarating chases, nail-biting espionage, terrifying battles, grand speeches, descriptions of exotic lands, and of course joking around in and out of character are all hallmarks of good roleplaying.

Most good stories include conflict. This will usually end up being between the the player-characters and either NPCs or some other element in the story. When a conflict arises, resolve it by rolling a skill-check. Please see the [checks](#checks) section for help with this.

# Setting
A setting is a template for worldbuilding. It includes a description of the world, the typical speed of characters in the world for combat purposes, how many character points new characters in the world should start with, a list of mandatory skills, and a list of skills common within the setting. The description usually includes a the technological level, magic, history, spacial/geographic scope, flora, fauna, biomes, natural resources, items, culture, store, etc.
To be mechanically playable a setting needs an action delay, starting character points, a list of mandatory skills, a list of common skills, and a  general description. Splitting the description into the cultural and the physical can be helpful. Creating a store is a good idea in most cases.

## Action Delay
The default action delay for the setting is what all new characters in the setting will start with. This will guarantee that most of the characters in the setting are at about the same speed in combat and chases. Because it is just a default and can be modified it also allows for some characters to be faster or slower than the average character.
<!-- everything below from storyteller section on action delay-->
Choosing a suitable action delay is fairly easy but it is possible to mess it up. If the action delay is too high, counting out AUTs becomes tedious and modifying a characters action delay by small numbers becomes less meaningful. On the other hand choosing a default action delay that is too low will greatly increase turn collisions and make it such that characters with non-default action delays have very different "speeds". Default action delay effectively determines the typical speed for characters in the setting. Having an abnormal action delay is how a character becomes faster or slower. AUTs are arbitrary units of time and I think this is what I will be calling initiative "ticks" because depending on the combat they can vary wildly.

## Character Points
Character Points, also known as CP, are a resource used by players throughout the game to take new skills and flavor and level up existing skills. The suggested starting character points for a setting is basically a recommendation for starting level. If characters start with 30 CP rather than 25 they will be a little stronger on average. There is usually a positive correlation between the number of mandatory skills in a setting and the starting CP.

## Common/Available skills
Available skills are skills that every character in a setting has access to. Any character can learn these skills with storyteller approval either at character creation or during the story. Players are encouraged to suggest additions to the list of available skills for the setting. Available skills are where characters get their options for interesting actions. A few examples of available skills are `swordfighting`, `necromancy`, `seduction`, and `piloting`. Available skills can be purchased with CP at character creation and during the story by any character. Characters do not need to have every available skill.

## Mandatory Skills
Mandatory skills are those that every character must have to be make sure they will not have checks that they should be able to roll but cannot. For instance, `seeing` and `hearing` are both skills almost every humanoid character should have so that they can perceive the game world. Every character must have one level in every mandatory skill but can take more levels if they wish.

## Technology and Magic Descriptions
A couple of initial questions players usually have when they are making characters in a new setting are "Is there magic?" and "What is the technological level?" and for this reason the answers to these questions should be on the setting. They are commonly asked, important, and usually easy to answer. If there is any fictitious magic in the setting it should be described here.

## Store
First off *the* store doesn't really exist after character creation. Characters will have to go stores in the story to purchase things listed on *the* store. Going to *a* store within the story rather than *the* store will drastically affect what is available for sale and maybe even what it is legal to trade. This is all subject to DTMS checks and storyteller approval after character creation. Anyway, *the* store is set up as a series of priced columns. The flavor section describes the purchasing power of various pieces of flavor-money, also known as AUTs. The columns should be "Trivial", "Minor", "Major", and "unreachable/Unreachable?". Trivial purchases are effectively free, minor purchases are worth one CP, major purchases need to be roleplayed for or a deal needs to be struck, and unreachable purchases are typically too expensive to ever purchase. Unreachable purchases may become available through roleplaying. The columns of the store should all have things characters can purchase in/under them.
<!-- everything below from the storyteller section on store/money-->
Money in Tabula is handled with things called AUCs. An AUC is an arbitrary unit of currency. In this game an AUC might be 1000 spacebucks or $10 or an ounce of gold. The point is that it is money. The way Tabula organizes money is so that you don't have to do much bookkeeping with your money. Groupings of AUCs form different levels of purchasing power. One AUC is one minor purchase. Three AUCs are a major purchase. There are 4 tiers of purchasing power. The first is trivial, then minor, major, and unreachable. To ground this in the real human world trivial purchases are things like food, beer, candy, ammo, clothes, or entertainment. A minor purchase would be things that cost more like guns, cars, specialized tools, computers, or medicine. Major purchases would be things like houses, companies, famous art, fancy cars, or a college education. A unreachable purchase is one that you simply cannot buy right now because it is either far to expensive or it is unavailable.
I think to actually make the store on the setting it should be the four columns with various goods underneath them. (columns are trivial, minor, major, and unreachable)

## Tone
It is typically a good idea to set expectations for the tone of the story such that people have the same expectations for the game and those expectations are met. It can ruin a scary horror campaign to have a bunch of goofy shit happening all the time. It can ruin a serious campaign to have a character named reginald fuck-hammer. Siilarly it can ruin a goofy space-romp to have a character with a depressing or sinister history.

## Social Description
The social description for the setting should describe what the people of the setting are like and what they have done. This will be things like important places, institutions, cultural events, and historic events. This will also include the races/peoples/cultures within the setting and the countries and governments they have formed.

## Physical Description
The physical description for the setting should describe what the land itself is like (assuming there is land). This would be things like geography, weather, plants, and animals. This goes well with spacial scope and a map.

### Spacial Scope
Settings have a size. They might be the entire known universe but even that has a size. Tell your players what that is. It is worth noting that you can have settings that are smaller than the known world and have multiple settings within the same story. A map with a some kind of scale marker and a region marked out as the place the setting governs is a good idea.

# Character
Characters are representations of the fictional people within the setting. To be mechanically playable a character needs an action delay, a motivation, skills, and flavor and a number of other shit.

## Motivations
Characters must have at least one motivation and typically fewer than five motivations. Motivations can be Ideals, Values, Causes, or anything else that causes the character to get out bed in the morning.
> Alice is motivated by escaping wonderland and finding her way home. Harry is motivated to defeat the dark lord to protect his friends. 

## Character Creation
Characters need skills, flavor and an action delay to be playable. The first thing a player should do when making a character is take a look at the [setting](#setting), read through it and make sure they understand the world. Players can propose things be added to the setting because they are supposed to have a mild influence upon what exists within the setting.

### How to Fill out a Character Sheet
First fill out the top of your character sheet. In order, the boxes should contain the character's name, the character's concept, the setting's name, your name, and the setting's action delay. A character concept can be thought of as the canonical or stereotypical version of something. The setting's action delay can be found in the upper left corner of the setting template.

### Adding Skills to the Setting
Probably the coolest part of this system is that it allows players to make their own skills. This requires co-operation from you, the storyteller. Your job is to vet and occasionally veto skills players have proposed as additions to the setting. Rather than a veto however you can put some [limiting factors](#limiting-factors) on a skill to make it less disruptive.

#### problems with previous iterations (scope and ... ?)
tl;dr players could make skills that were vague and applied to every scenario and then max them.
- using incredibly broad skills that apply to every scenario. "social graces" applies to every social situation, provides little character depth, and makes it so a player can use the dice to walk all over the game.
an example tree of skill scope
> animal skills  
>> riding  
>>> horses  
>>> camels  
>>> elephants  
>> driving  
>>> oxen  
>>> mules and horses  
>>> dogs  
>> care  
>>> grooming  
>>> feeding  
>>> breeding  
>>> veterinary  
>>>> first aid  
>>>> diagnosis  
>>>> medicine  
>>>> surgery    
A character might know “knots” because they know the skill “sailing” and that’s fine even though the character is getting a lot of skills for free under the umbrella-skill of “sailing”. 
On the other hand I encouraged THIS at one point.
perhaps settings should include a list of default/common skills?
there is something of a goldilocks zone for skill scope. Magic is too broad, fireball is too narrow, but fire magic is just right.

#### Limiting factors
To limit a how disruptive a skill can be to your story a few things are necessary. Firstly, make it clear to the players that while their character *might* be the first character to have a skill they will probably not be the only character to have this skill. Next adding a cooldown, timing restriction, or cost to a skill can go a long way to making the skill less disruptive. You will have to come up with your own rules regarding this. Keep in mind they should be short and simple.

### Motivations
<!-- is this its own section or should it be a part of flavor. misc info?-->
Each character should have at least one motivation and probably not more than 5 though this number is flexible. Motivations describe at a high level what your character wants from the world in which the story takes place and gives the storyteller useful ways to interact with your character. NPCs should also have motivations to influence the difficulty of their persuasion and willpower tests.

### Skills
Second, your character needs [skills](#skills). Skills are used to roll checks which is how a character interacts with the game world. Skills are usually self-descriptively named and have levels. The higher level the skill the better at it a character is.
There are two kinds of skills. Mandatory skills and the normal kind. Mandatory skills are skills every character _needs_ within the setting. They are listed at the top of the skills section in the setting. Add all of the mandatory skills to your character sheet. The rest of the skills are those that are common within the setting and you can take any of them you can afford. Players can also propose to the storyteller that skills be added to the setting. You pay for your starting skills using character points. Starting character points are listed in the upper left of the setting. Skills cost a number of character points equal to the level you want the skill to start at. An important note about skills is that players are encouraged to add new skills to the list of available skills in the setting. Storyteller approval is required for a skill to to be added to the setting.

```
Example mandatory skills: willpower, strength, magic, dexterity, charisma
Example skills: sword fighting, pyromancy, computer hacking, seduction
```

### Flavor
Third, your character needs [flavor](#flavor). Flavor is a word or short phrase describing a character. It can include knowledge, possessions, physique, and even social position. Review the starting flavor options listed on the setting. This will almost always give your character a language, clothes, and equipment relevant for the setting. When the setting specifies a type of flavor but not what it is specifically you get to choose something that would fit within the setting. Add your choice of starting flavor to your character sheet. Afterward, add flavor to your character to describe them. Flavor costs one character point per after you have your starting flavor. Flavor is usually just that, flavor, but occasionally it can make checks easier or harder.

### Action Delay
I have been thinking about a procedural way for players to modify action delay. If I suggest a typical action delay of 10 for every setting then I think it would be reasonable to allow players to modify their action delays at a cost equal to the difference between the desired AD and 10 squared. This would only work for decreasing a characters AD as characters should not be able to max out a character for non-combat stuff by deciding to never have a turn. Instead I think it might be reasonable to give players the default option to increase their character's size by increasing their action delay. I am unsure how to price reductions in action delay that started above ten. I think the same cost progression just starting form the character's starting AD. I guess characters will need to document their starting AD on their character sheets.

### Non-Player Characters
Tabula treats NPCs the same as every other character. They should have motivations, skills, flavor, action delay, and all the other fields of a character sheet filled out. Creating them should be relatively quick as you only need to fill things in as necessary and can leave most of their character points un-spent. Careful, as this can result in some very min-maxed NPCs. NPCs should always have motivations to influence their decisions. Make sure you include motivation.

### Printable Character Sheet
![characterSheet.png not found](characterSheet.png "Printable Character Sheet")
## Skills 
Each character has a list of skills representing the actions they can take in the story. Skills do have to be things that a character can *do* which also means they have to be able to fail as well. The setting will have a comprehensive list of skills available in the setting.
<!-- examples -->

### Mandatory Skills
All characters should have the ability to attack, defend, move, hide, see, lie, detect lies, persuade, resist persuasion, etc. The list of mandatory skills on the setting should represent these potential actions. All characters must have all mandatory skills for their setting. Mandatory skills are typically for actions that a character doesn't have a more suitable common skill for. Alternatively they are for performing very basic actions that every character must be able to perform like `seeing` or feats of `strength`. 

### Common Skills
Common skills are those that can be found in a setting. Not every character has these skills but most characters should be able to learn them given the opportunity. There will be a list of common skills within the setting document that players can add to their characters. Additionally, players can propose skills be added to the list of common skills found within the setting.

### Gambits
At its most basic a gambit is a deal you make with the storyteller. Anyone can propose a gambit but all parties must agree before the dice are rolled for the gambit to take effect.
Two common gambits would be to go for a called shot in combat or to take your time with an action out of combat. Raise the difficulty for the called shot and make it insta-kill. Lower the difficulty for the careful action and lower the quality of a success.

### Acquisition
New skills can be obtained at character creation by taking them off the list of skills and paying one CP per level of the desired skill and all previous levels of the skill recursively. For instance a level 3 skill would cost 6: 1 point for the first level, 2 CP for the second, and 3 CP for the third level cumulatively. To obtain new skills in the story ask the storyteller if you can being learning the skill.

### Progression
Skills level up once they have been used a number of times equal to their level. For example, to level up a level 7 `sword-fighting` a player would need to succeed at 7 `sword-fighting` checks. This usually means this will require over 7 attempts because failures do not earn exp. Mark successes next to the skill on your character sheet. 

### Mandatory Skills
Mandatory skills are those that every character must take some levels in. This is meant to represent the skills that every character should naturally have access to like `seeing`, `strength`, and `persuasion`. Granted, there are some characters who will have flavor that renders these skills useless or remove them entirely. The flavors `blind` and `paralyzed` come to mind.

### Available Skills
Available skills are those that are present in the setting but that not everyone has. They can be rare or common like `surgery` and `driving` are in modern times. The point is that not *every* character has them but most characters are able to learn these skills. Some more modern-day examples are cooking, driving, computer programming, basketball, and surgery.

## Flavor
Flavor is a mechanic in Tabula used to describe the interesting parts of a character. Almost anything unique that a character *is* or *has* is likely to be flavor. Flavor is used primarily for DTMS (does this make sense) checks and modifying the difficulty on checks. A few examples of flavor might be `armor`, `horse`, `landed noble`, `flaming sword`, `elf`, `big and tall`, etc. for an elvish knight of the summer court. Each piece of flavor should be a short, evocative description.

### Acquisition
Flavor can be gotten in three ways. First, it can be asked for an paid for with CP at character creation. It typically costs 1 CP per word for flavor at character creation unless modified by a deal. Second, it can be earned and paid for during the story similarly to at character creation. The only difference is that the storyteller may make you spend time in character to earn the flavor you want. Thirdly, flavor might be given to or inflicted upon a character as a result of the story. Lands and title may be given to a peasant after he rescues the princess but he may have also taken some fire damage from the dragon guarding here and have a half-melted face now.

### Bad Flavor
Negative flavor is usually gotten in two ways. The first way is usually through deals. Rather than asking for a piece of flavor that does something good and something bad a player might ask for a piece of flavor that is mostly bad and ask to be compensated for it. In return for their character being blind a player might ask that their character be *paid* 3 or 4 CP rather than spending 1 for that piece of flavor.
The second way characters usually get negative flavor is from combat. When one character lops off another character's hand with a sword that new `-1 hand` will need to be remembered unless that character ceases to matter. Flavor can handle arbitrary negative effects like wounds perfectly.

### Deals
At character creation you may have noticed that there is no way to modify action delay. There is also no way to get any special racial abilities. There is also no way to become rich and famous. Etc. The point is you have to talk to the storyteller when you are creating your character, ask for the things you want, and represent them as flavor. Sometimes the things you want are OP as shit and the DM will want to keep your character in line by raising the cost above the normal for what you are asking for. Want to be super fast? Have -2 action delay by being a vampire (instead death by sunlight). Want to be big enough you can throw cars? Become an Ent for +3 action delay and a vulnerability to fire. Perhaps you can be a world famous boxer if you also have some gambling debts. The point is, talk to your DM and work it out. Sometimes it is appropriate to add a deal to the setting such that it is available to all players and NPCs.

### Items
Unlike most other roleplaying games which have extensive tables for equipment, in Tabula I have opted to represent equipment as flavor. This means that armor, weapons, tools, vehicles, and treasure should be represented as flavor. Typically equipment will modify the difficulty of checks with relevant skills sometimes reducing the difficulty from `impossible` and effectively granting a character new abilities.

### Money
Money is represented as flavor in Tabula. Character points can be converted into minor purchases. Money-flavor represents a character's liquid assets or the stuff they have for trade. Money-flavor can be aliased to whatever the currency for you game is: `gold coins`, `spacebucks`, `dollars`, `bullets`, `litres (of water)`, etc. If you want to know more go visit the [Money](#money-1) section. Typically money can be spent on things on the settings store as long as you find a store selling that thing in-game.

### Social Flavor
The in-game doors that position and status unlock are also represented by flavor. Typically this might look like `respected businessman`, `landed noble`, `kings advisor`, or `internet personality`. The effect of this stuff is purely RP and it will be up to the player to use it to its fullest. A character's job is always worth having as flavor because this has social implications in most societies. A character may or may not have a reputation but if they do it is worth putting down what it is and what group of people will know about it.

### Supernatural Flavor
Supernatural flavor is how one might represent being a priest to a specific god. Seriously just put down `priest of Khorn` to be that. Similarly if a character is `haunted`, `blessed`, or in a `demonic pact` just put those things down. That covers the social aspect of supernatural flavor. On the other hand a character could be `magically adept`, `unnaturally sweaty`, or `the chosen one`.

### Relationships
If you have another character as a companion you should list them as flavor or make a character sheet for them. Any animal companions, demonic familiars, slaves, shipboard AI, or loyal friends should be either listed as flavor or have their own character sheet made or both. Whatever is most apt. Consult the deals section and the storyteller.

### Knowledge
Knowledge should be represented as flavor unless that knowledge would be better represented as a skill. You cannot have a flavor and skill that are functionally identical such that the flavor just lowers the difficulty on all of that skills checks. Languages, secrets, history, specific domains of skilled labor, culture, religious rites, etc. are all examples of in character knowledge that should be represented as flavor.

### Vehicles and Properties
Horses, boats, spaceships, cars, planes, tanks, etc.
Houses, castles, countries, skyscrapers, private islands, secret bases, etc.

### Physical
Physicality is also represented as flavor. This includes but is not limited to body type, species, race, deformities, aesthetic, and disabilities. An example of each, in order, would be `fat`, `human`, `white`, `missing an ear`, `well dressed`, and `peg-leg`.


# Gameplay
This section goes into detail on the typical systems involved in roleplaying and how this game choses to do them instead. Some of these will be very far from typical given that there is no source material to reference for skills, items, monsters, etc.

## Crafting
In Tabula, crafting is just a skill check. Describe what you want and how you plan on using your crafting skill to get it, ask the DM what the difficulty is, and make the roll. If you succeed you get the desired item, likely with some narrative flair heavily influenced by magnitude of success. If you fail you do not get what you asked for, any materials and time put into the crafting roll are non refundable, and it is possible something bad happens based on the event die if the storyteller chooses to use it.

## Money
In Tabula, money is represented even more abstractly than usual as flavor. Before we get into that lets talk about how money spends in roleplaying games. A simple breakdown of prices would be to say that things can be non-numerically priced as trivial, minor, major, unreachable. The legality and availability of items will vary with the story. It is intended that minor and major purchases be acquired through roleplaying.

### Trivial Purchases
Trivial purchases are things like food, clothes, entertainment, ammunition, and gasoline that should typically be available to the players with little fuss. Trivial purchases are small enough that players don't have to keep track of the money used for trivial purchases at all. It is assumed that characters have either income or savings from which they spend to pay for their trivial purchases with no meaningful net gain or loss. (w00t communism; w00t privilege).

### Minor Purchases
Next, minor purchases are things like tools, weapons and armor, vehicles, medicine, and jewelry. Minor purchases are typically worth one CP and should be represented as the flavor `minor purchase`. A character can have multiple of the `minor purchase` flavor.

### Major Purchases
Major purchases are just like minor purchases except they can purchase more expensive things. Major purchases can typically purchase companies, elite training, houses, spaceships and the like. Major purchases should be represented as the flavor `major purchase` as many times as is necessary.

### Unreachable Purchases
Lastly and of least importance we have unreachable purchases. unreachable purchases are things that are so expensive that no character has any hope of ever purchasing them.

## Checks
When conflict occurs during roleplaying the fairest way to resolve it most times is by rolling a skill-check. A skill-check is where one of a character's skills is tested against a subjective difficulty determined by the storyteller based on flavor and story elements. Each level a character has in a skill will give them one d6 towards the check. The target difficulty is typically 5 and can be modified. Each die is rolled and if a character gets any successes among their dice pool the check is a success.

### Difficulty
The difficulty of a skill check can be modified by a number of things. A character's flavor, other characters, and the world itself can all cause a skill-check to become easier or harder. The storyteller decides if any of these things is meaningful enough to make the roll easy or hard. What this means for the check is that the target number for the success of an individual die changes based on the subjective difficulty. The usual difficulty is 5 meaning 5's and 6's are successes. For hard checks only 6's are successes. For easy checks 4's, 5's, and 6's are all successes. Checks with a difficulty of impossible are automatic failures and checks with a difficulty of trivial are automatic successes.

### Nested Checks
If a character is trying to do two things at once, juggling while doing a backflip for instance, just increase the difficulty. If a player is doing two things that are radically different, that is the appropriate time to make two skill checks. (Doing a backflip and casting a spell)

### Aquisition and Progression
Taking new skills and leveling them up use the same process. Skills always cost a number of CP (Character Points) equal to the desired level of the skill. You must spend CP on each level individually. Taking a new skill costs 1 CP. Leveling that skill up to level 2 costs 2 CP. The total for this is 3 CP. Taking a skill at level 5 during character creation costs 15 CP. Get storyteller approval before taking new skills during a story. Otherwise skills can be leveled up any time.

### Gambits
Gambits are where you make a deal with the storyteller to modify the the difficulty of a check, the pass-effect, and the fail-effect. You might ask for something special to happen on a success in exchange for an increase in difficulty.

### Magnitude of Success
When a character succeeds at a check sometimes this is not enough to determine success or failure. This happens most often in contests between multiple characters like races and contests of strength. It can also color the following narration of a check if a character gets a large magnitude of success on a typical check. Anyway, to get magnitude of success a character has to succeed. The number of successes on the dice is their magnitude of success.

### Contests
For contests rather than just looking at whether or not a character succeeded look at the magnitude of success. Magnitude of success is how many successes were rolled on the contest check. The character with the most wins the contest.
Examples of contests include arm wrestling and racing. Characters can tie contests.

### DTMS Checks
There is one special kind of die that the storyteller will make frequently. These are DTMS (Does this make sense?) checks. They don't use dice. This is just the storyteller deciding if something is possible within the world or not.

## Stealth and Perception (fill me out!)
This should probably be combined with the lying section...

### Perception
Perception can be rolled any time a character becomes suspicious and would like to look around for something. Typical skills for perception are `seeing` and `hearing` though more interesting ones are common in high magic and high tech settings. The storyteller can also indicate that a player should roll a spot check or simply give players information without a check. There is no passive perception in Tabula. Characters attempting to hide can slip up and do something that is perceptible or a spot check can be trivially easy but there is no passive perception. To roll a perception check declare what you are looking for as vaguely or as specifically as you like, get the subjective difficulty from the storyteller, roll the check, and stand by the result.

### Hidden
Being hidden is the typical starting state for a stealth scene. If one character is hidden, other characters don't know they are there. Whenever they want to make actions they will have to roll stealth checks to avoid alerting other characters.

### Alerted
Alerted characters are those who have seen, heard, smelled, or sensed something strange and are going to look around for it. They can make various perception checks like investigation, searching, seeing, smelling, etc. to try and uncover hidden things and characters. If an alerted character succeeds at their check to detect a hidden character then the hidden character goes from hidden to detected. Use DTMS checks for taking characters out of the alerted state. The NPCs will probably eventually get bored if they don't find anything.

### Detected
Detected characters are no longer hidden or in stealth. Everyone can interact with them normally or as though their location is known. Whether one character can detect another is strongly dependant on DTMS checks. A blind man can't detect anyone precisely but he can be alerted and alert other character. A character with ESP can probably sense characters through stealth even if they didn't fail any stealth checks which would have alerted the character with ESP.

### Surprise
When a character or synchronized group of hidden characters start a combat they start on turn 0 at the very beginning of the initiative track. Other characters roll for initiative in the usual way.

## Lying
In Tabula, lying is defined as trying to get other characters to believe information that is not true or at the very least to get other characters to believe that you believe that information. This is not persuasion. Mechanically, lying is resisted in an entirely different way from persuasion and more closely resembles stealth. Where persuasion is resisted by willpower lying has no specific resistance roll or skill. Instead it is always resisted by knowledge and DTMS checks. Characters may become suspicious if your lie isn't good enough or they may happen to know the truth and can catch you in the lie immediately. As a point of order IRL it is night impossible to detect lying, but it is possible to tell if someone is uncomfortable or something like that when certain topics are brought up. If you are trying to convince a character to act on untrue information you might need to make both lying and persuasion checks. If you don't have to make a lying check the lie might factor into the difficulty of the persuasion check.

### Suspicious
When a character is suspicious they don't know you are lying but things don't quite add up and they want more information. If you fail on your lying check characters typically become suspicious and begin looking for more information so they can get to the truth (if they care).

### Fooled
When you have fooled a character they have effectively accepted the false information you have presented. They will operate on this naturally. If they find something that contradicts this information they will become suspicious. A fooled character will not typically look for the truth of things because they believe they have found it.

### Caught
When a character catches you in a lie you are caught. They will act as though the information you have presented is false and as though you were trying to deceive them. They may go as far as to tell other characters about your deception.

## Persuasion, Willpower, and Motivations

### Persuasion
Persuasion is a mandatory skill in most settings. It is any character's ability to persuade another character to do something. It is resisted by willpower and the difficulty of both rolls is strongly affected by motivations. If a character tries to persuade another based on something that isn't true, that action might require a deception roll in addition to the perception check, or it might just increase the difficulty of the perception check. It depends on how suspicious the mark is of the false information.

### Motivations
Motivations are what a character wants. These are a characters dreams, long term goals, morality, and fears. Some examples of motivations are `family legacy`, `money`, `serving the gods`, `following the law`, `afraid of spiders`, `pride`, and many many more. Motivations strongly influence the difficulty of most persuasion and willpower rolls.

### Willpower
You can only defend if you know you are being attacked. if we have attributes all characters get a check against persuasion. otherwise they don't unless they have a relevant skill. Mandatory skills make this a lot better. Everyone has to have the `willpower` skill perhaps?
this is a good time to mention that when you try to convince a character of something they don't _have_ to be convinced. instead they can thing about it a bit and roll some relevant "resist persuasion" rolls which probably uses __willpower__. It is worth noting that not every persuasion roll needs an accompanying willpower roll to resist it. Sometimes a character has no reason to attempt to rest a persuasion roll.

## Combat
<!-- this should be a BRIEF description of combat and a more lengthy description of why it is necessary -->
Combat in Tabula, unlike many roleplaying games, is based on AUTs and action cooldowns. AUTs, or Arbitrary Units of Time, are usually around one second but can be modified to suit the scale of the battle. During combat it is the storyteller's job to call out the current AUT starting from 0 and counting up. Characters participating the fight have their actions refreshed every time a number of AUTs have passed equal to their action delay. On the AUT a character's actions refresh that character can use as many of their actions as they want by describing them and rolling skill checks as appropriate. When all characters acting on an AUT are done taking actions the storyteller calls out the next AUT. It is intended that players track the action cooldowns for their characters. Repeat until the fight is over.

### Rolling Initiative
<!-- this should be a purely mechanical description of how to start a combat -->
To start a combat scene each character involved will need to roll initiative. To do this each character rolls one d6. The number of pips represents how many turns it will be until that character can act in the combat. I haven't decided if starting delay should be 1d6 or 1d6+AD (AD=a characters action delay).

### Turns
<!-- this should be a purely mechanical description of how characters take their turns-->
<!-- all of the various actions should be subsections to this-->
Character get turns in combat based on their action delay. Effectively a character's action delay determines the cooldown on their actions. If a character has an action delay of 5 they will get to act every 5 ticks of initiative. If they started on initiative tick 8 this means they will act on 8, 13, 18, 23 and so on. Characters that start a combat go on 0. Other characters get 1d6 action delay before they can act in the combat. When a character's turn rolls around they get all of their spent actions back.
At the start of their turn a characters actions refresh. Actions include a major action, a move action, and a reaction. A move action can be moved for moving and occasionally for dodging when combined with a reaction. A reaction can be spent to hold your action. An action can be used for pretty much everything. A reaction can be used to make a dodge or block check. Major actions are usually used for attacking or interacting in combat. A major action can be used with a reaction to launch a counterattack. Lots of things are free actions: Talking and directing minions is a good example of this. Doing a defensive action for another player costs a reaction and a major action. Whenever you use you reaction you get to take a defensive action as long as it makes sense. Whenever you want to use a move or major action and it is not your tick of initiative it will cost your reaction. Major actions can also be replaced with an additional move action or reaction.


#### Major Actions
Major actions are used to do pretty much everything in combat other than move or take out-of-turn actions. Most of the time you will need to use a major action to attack, interact with the environment, cast spells, create advantages or disadvantages, etc.

##### Attacking
Attacking costs an action. All attacks are called shots. Describe the attack to the storyteller and they will assign a difficulty. The storyteller does not have to reveal all of an NPCs defences or their effect on the difficulty of attacks made against that NPC but in general they should because it saves time. If a player makes an attack and passes the check and passes it the called shot just happens as usual unless the defender has relevant defences the attacker didn't know about. The idea here is that weak enemies can be defeated outright and you will need to chip down the defences of more difficult enemies before you can defeat them. Attacks that result in wounds that will take a long time to heal or will never heal should be marked on the relevant character sheet as flavor. The difficulty of an attack is based on any relevant flavor like armor and weapons, the context of the attack, and how difficult the called shot is. Consider the attacker's weapon and the defender's armor. Consider context like visibility, elevation, flanking, wounds, etc. Consider how these things influence the difficulty of that specific called shot. Consider the players opinions on what the difficulty should be. To disable and capture an enemy make the appropriate called shot. Weapons do damage in a way that makes sense. Swords do sword-damage, guns do gun-damage and fireballs do fireball-damage. Respective this would be things like cuts/stabs, bullet wounds, and being blown up/set on fire. If wounds (bad flavor from combat) would make a character's ability to move non-trivial, that character is downed. If a character's ability to perform actions ever becomes impossible that character is either unconscious or incapacitated and possibly dead. If a character is ever incapacitated, downed, or unconscious they are likely at risk of being killed by a coup de gras. For all of these things make "does this make sense" checks.

##### advantages and disadvantages
As an action character may attempt to create an advantage for themselves or a disadvantage for another character. If the action succeeds whomever is controlling the character gets to describe the advantage they create. If the storyteller finds it reasonable it happens. If not, don’t waste time arguing, just move on.
An advantage can also take the form of having to roll fewer dice on a skill check in the future, extra damage dice on an attack roll, or a bonus to initiative. Inversely an advantage might mean that the character’s opponents have to roll more dice on skill checks, get fewer dice on their damage rolls, or lose initiative.

##### Interactions
Players can decide to make non-combative actions during a combat like reading a scroll to help decipher a puzzle or pulling a lever to open a door. These things are typically major actions as they are distracting and take time. Many other things are major actions. Note to self: add some more examples.

#### Move Actions
Move actions are the simplest of the actions. If you need to change zones in battle you will need to make a move action. That said small bits of movement in the same zone like footwork in combat or walking two meters to a different computer terminal would not be considered large enough movement to require a move action. Sometimes when using a reaction to dodge the dodge won't make sense unless it also moves you. In this case you will also need a move action.

##### Zones
Rather than using a traditional grid I would recommend forming zones for your combat scene. If you want to use an image as a map you can either subdivide the sections of the map into large sections or overlay a large grid on the image to form zones. These zones should be about the size of one movement action. If you are simply describing a map you can just describe the zones. Each movement action will allow a player to change zones. There are no meaningful units of distance in this system. Use your brain if something that requires distance comes up.

##### Dodging
Some defensive actions require a character to get out of the way to avoid an attack. In these cases character will need to spend a movement action in addition to a reaction to make a defensive action.

#### Reactions
Reactions are actions that characters can use to act out of turn. This is most commonly used for defensive actions. Anytime a character uses their reaction they can make a free defensive action. Acting out of turn to counterattack, defend yourself or another character, or by holding a major action all require a character's reaction.

##### Defensive Actions
Defensive actions are those that characters do to avoid the bad flavor that comes with an attack. Commonly this means blocking, dodging, parrying, etc. Uncommonly this means counterattacking to remove a threat before it can hurt you, or jumping in front of an attack for another character.

### Transitions
Feel tree to maintain or drop initiative as you switch between chases, combats, and stealth scenes. Use logic to determine when it appropriate to switch between these and when to roll and drop initiative. Characters that start a combat or chase should go first. Characters need to be hidden if they want to start a stealth scene. Any of these can transition into any of the others. Chases are just combat with movement instead of fighting. Initiative for chases and combats works the same.

### Entering and Leaving combat
Entering combat is simple. When a player decides they would like to enter combat they do so in 1d6+AD AUTs. The same goes for the storyteller's NPCs. Characters must pass a DTMS check to join combat ie. they must be present.


### War
Once the number of NCPs gets into the double digits it doesn't make a whole lot of sense to actually play the individual characters in combat. In this case the NPCs battle is narrated with the PCs party being able to influence the outcome through their success or failure in smaller battles where most of the combatants matter. This is also a good time to include the event die. When the storyteller ends up controlling more than triple the number of units the PCs do that is probably a good time to change things to a simultaneous battle and war.

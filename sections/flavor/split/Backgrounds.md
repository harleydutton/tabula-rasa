This is one of the three subtypes of [[Flavor]] per the [[New Flavor Plan]]. The goal of backgrounds is to describe what a character **is** or what they **know** and this can potentially be much broader in scope than normal flavor.

Presumably it should go live in [[Character Creation]] section because it doesn't specifically interact with any other subsystems.

A list of potential backgrounds could be useful. In a fantasy setting you will want to include all of the magical species here. If you feel the need to balance the versatility of magic out by giving it a downside you could include “magic user” as a background and use it to gatekeep and give downsides to magic. It is also worth listing which backgrounds are incompatible here. Typically players will want to add to this list.

Wizard - must be 30+ and a virgin
Vampire - catches on fire in the sun, needs to drink blood, pretty, strong, ageless etc.
Goblin - Bad reputation, short, ugly, don’t live long
Robot - Immune to electric and mental damage, cannot heal but can be repaired with crafting checks. Can modify body and knowledge easily. Needs to charge, doesn’t need to eat or sleep. Cannot be a wizard.

I think this is the same idea as [[Traits]] and belongs adjacent to [[Savage Worlds and flavor as status effects]]

I should make a species/classes definition so settings can easily list them. species/classes is too generic. "collections of flavor" is apt but sounds stupid. IDK what the name should be but the concept is that games will frequently have collections of flavor like "vampire" which means "drinks blood", "dies to sunlight", "pretty", "supernatural healing", and "undead". I need a system for this.

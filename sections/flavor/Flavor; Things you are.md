~~Define more flavor systems than just money and items. What does it mean to be a species?~~

I should make a species/classes definition so settings can easily list them. species/classes is too generic. "collections of flavor" is apt but sounds stupid. IDK what the name should be but the concept is that games will frequently have collections of flavor like "vampire" which means "drinks blood", "dies to sunlight", "pretty", "supernatural healing", and "undead". I need a system for this.

[[Wealth]] -> Items handles the things a character has. These are still flavor?
[[big Skills]] handle the things a character can do.
Flavor handles the things a character is.
[[balance decisions]] flavor is linear (one CP gets you one flavor)


flavor's difficulty modifier can only ever make a roll one step easier.

[[Attribute]]s are intended to be health pools in addition to all the other shit they do.

There are going to be a couple different systems for handling "health", "damage", and "death" in various scenarios

## Physical
This one is the most straight-forward.

Whenever a character takes damage, they receive a [[Wound]] [[sections/flavor/Flavor]]. 
[[Character 1|Characters]] can have as many [[Wound|wounds]] as they have points in [[Body 1|body]] before falling [[Unconsious]].
Characters with more wounds than body [[Death|die]].
Characters with at least one wound and one fewer wound than body are considered `bloodied`.
Players can ask the [[Storyteller]] if character's are `bloodied`.
The storyteller decides what happens to [[Unconsious]]. [[Death]] is an option.
Heal wounds as would be appropriate.


## Mental
This is largely the same system as the physical one.
Mental health is represented by [[Mind 1]]
The wounds should be mental rather than physical in nature. Psychosis, sleepwalking, paranoia, etc.
Being incapacitated in this instance just means you lose control of your character. A fight/flight/freeze response is appropriate here.
Being mentally dead is probably being a vegatable or a gibbering mess or something.
Healing mental wounds can be way more difficult. Doors of sleep, forgetting, madness, and death are relevant here.


## Reputation
The social variation of this system uses the [[Social 1]] [[Attribute]].
This is intended to represent social standing or reputation.
Death is inteneded to be you getting run out of town.
A social wound is having a (few) [[Character 1|character(s)]] turn against you. 
A social incapacitation would be getting kicked out of an important organization.
A social death would be to have this social malize begin spreading to your other social circles or resulting in consequences like mob lynching or assassins.
Healing social problems requires roleplaying.
Reputation is also localized. If you join a new group your reputation might follow you (if you are "socially dead" but you will probably have a clean bill of "social health")

## Morality
This uses the [[Spirit 1]] attribute and behaves similarly to the physical health system.
Whatever your character believes in, acting against it will cause you spiritual wounds.
Spiritual wounds must be healed through roleplaying.
Spiritual incapacitation and death might result in divine wrath and smitings/hauntings or just a mental crisis that results in mental wounds.

	- [[big Health]] and damage system as currently imagined (physical; adapt for mental/[[Presence]]. Spiritual [[big Health]] tracks morality)
	- [[Body]] is a [[Character 1]]â€™s capacity to receive wounds (flavor) before going unconscious.
	- [[Storyteller]] represents characters as weak/vulnerable/bloody once they have [[Body]]-1 wounds.
	- characters with wounds equal to [[Body]] are incapacitated. [[Storyteller]] discretion as to what happens to them
	- characters with more wounds than [[Body]] die

A "wound" is bad flavor gotten through combat from taking damage. Wounds give a -1 to all checks due to pain and possibly disability.

If I want to actually implement a wound system, I should probably add in common flavor's to represent status effects like "pain" and "shock" to give these temporary dice penalties. Realistically this should just be modifying the difficulty of the roll though because players should be the only ones modifying the dice pools of a check.

[[Consider]] a system I heard about recently, I think for savage worlds. The basic premise is that when you take physical damage you get some quantity of pain, shock and blood loss.
- shock gives you an immediate, temporary, and short lived disadvantage to your rolls.
- pain gives you a slightly delayed, somewhat lasting disadvantage to your rolls
- blood loss will eventually kill you in some fashion

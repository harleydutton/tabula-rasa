what is it:
it's a [[GTA Wanted Meter]] and also kinda a morality system. this one specifically deals with the supernatural. It is a [[Descriptors|Descriptor]], usually a [[Statuses|Status]]. 

getting it:
- doing anything that pisses of a supernatural entity might get you a curse
- doing things against your god or moral code might get you a curse
	- players need to choose/define a god/code
- you can still be cursed by a witch (but more generically)

healing it:
- atonement, repentance, penance, etc. based on the god/code:
	- you must try to undo the thing
	- you must sacrifice something
	- you have to figure out how to talk to your higher power and get a pardon

dying from it:
- spooky shit and warnings at 0, maybe mental or physical chip damage
- when a character has more curses than [[Spirit]] they should start experiencing [[Cascading Problems]] leading to their character being [[Death|Unplayable]] in some way.

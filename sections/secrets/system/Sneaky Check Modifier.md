If you want to do something without getting caught, half of your action/check will need to be "sneaking" which is a [[Check Modifier]] which consumes your supporting action. If you get a partial success you get to choose which half, the action or the sneaking, fails. If you get a perfect success on the check you don't get caught.

This leaves me thinking that the main/supporting action system should always be something that can fail and something else it depends on. To this end shooting from stealth would be a shooting check with stealth as the other half of that.

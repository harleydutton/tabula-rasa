some actions are silent, need check, and loud - I think this is the sort of thing that gets handled by the storyteller and voting system. silent actions allow you to maintain stealth without a check, noisy actions will put you into [[Obvious]] no matter what, and "need check" actions need a check with the sneak mod.

does this add a second axis of difficulty to check that the existing difficulty system already handles? no, this is something else entirely. I could avoid this system with a more fleshed out check modifier or main/supporting action system.

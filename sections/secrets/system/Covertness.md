all actions are either covert, overt, or somewhere in between. For those actions in the middle, roll a check (or add a sneak modifier to the check) to see if the [[Sneak]] taking the action becomes [[Obvious]] or not. The storyteller will choose which of these three a given action is most of the time though the players can [[Challenging]] this and put it to a vote.

Covert actions will never make a [[Sneak]] [[Obvious]].
Overt actions will always make a Sneak Obvious.

There are some actions that will cause you to fail your stealth check immediately. something like hiding in a closet but also firing a gun will make a lot of noise and cause people to start looking around for the source of those gunshots. or do something else. The point is, you might be hidden but people will absolutely know somebody is somewhere firing a gun.

If a tree falls in the forest does it make a noise? Only if there is someone there to hear it. If you fail a stealth check, and no guards detect it, you aren't detected. Failing a stealth check just puts the ball in the guard's court. Then the guard must make a check to see if they detect you. Effectively this is a system of opposed checks for stealth that are only triggered when one side fails to sneak properly.

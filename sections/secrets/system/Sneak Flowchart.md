1. [[Sneak]] makes a check w/ [[Sneaky Check Modifier]]
	- fails - nothing happens, 2
	- partial success - action succeeds, 2
	- perfect success - action succeeds
2. some amount of time passes, 3.
3. [[Observer]] makes an observation check of some kind
	- fails - doesn't see anything
	- partial success - becomes [[Aware]]
	- perfect success - becomes [[Aware]] and causes a [[Cascading Problems]].

see [[Outcome]] for info on failure and partial/perfect successes.

I'm not sure if I want to use the sneaky check mod system or the main/supporting actions system.

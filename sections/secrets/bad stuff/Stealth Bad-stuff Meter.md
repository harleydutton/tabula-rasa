Roll [[The Event Die]] when players make/fail stealth actions. If it comes up 1, have something bad happen. Guards in another room gain some degree of awareness as per [[Observer State]].

To make this a [[Push Your Luck]] mechanic make bad stuff happen on numbers less than or equal to "the meter". (have "the meter" start at 1 and go up one every time bad stuff happens.

This is an implementation of the [[Cascading Problems]] idea.

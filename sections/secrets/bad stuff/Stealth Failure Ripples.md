Given that I'm using [[Zone]] based maps I can easily have stealth ripple outward. Basically whenever a stealth failure occurs have the state of the guards ([[Observer State]]) in the zone propagate to adjacent zones.

Effectively the same system as the [[Stealth Bad-stuff Meter]] in that failures bring in more trouble.

This is an implementation of the [[Cascading Problems]] idea.

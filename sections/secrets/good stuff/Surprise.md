This is a relevant stealth state for combat stuff. I think the guards would need to be below t3 alert to be surprised. I think I have different degrees of surprise for in combat somewhere around here. maybe in one of the initiative sections.

Attempting to enter stealth from a chase or combat costs an action, a stealth check, and somewhere to hide.

You get to take the first move in a fight! You start at initiative 0, 1d6, or [[Speed]] rather than xd6+speed like normal.

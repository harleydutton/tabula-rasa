Tabula treats NPCs the same as every other character. Make a character sheet for them. If they need to be combat capable make sure they have an AD. If they are there to talk make sure they have _at least_ one motivation. Give them CP based on how much you have given the players. It is a good idea to leave a large chunk of an NPCs CP unspent.

If you go through the character creation process for a non-player character (NPC), you should end up with a character of similar power level to the player characters (PCs), assuming you use the same amount of character points (CP). If they need to be combat capable make sure they have an action delay (AD) as outlined in the speed section. If you NPC is there for story purposes make sure they have _at least_ one motivation. Leaving a large chunk of your NPCs CP unspent keeps them flexible so they can grow to meet the needs of your story.

same as PCs but don't spend ALL of their exp immediately. allow them to fudge the numbers and gain skills as needed. maybe create their special skill if they have one immediately.
leveling up NPCs using the elder scrolls style tally marks might be a miserable pain. propose an alternative.

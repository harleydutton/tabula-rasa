as a storyteller, how many character points should you be distributing?
get 1-2 exp per session/in-game night.

1 per night for the group minimum
give more for:
- good RP
- completing objectives
- heroics
- in-the-moment leveling
- etc.
probably no more than 5 per night


Character points are given by the storyteller at character creation and usually also session by session. Character points are typically awarded for heroics, good roleplaying, and completing quests. The storyteller should keep a running total on the setting document of how many CP have been given out to the group.

When you want to perform an action involving multiple different skills you might have to make a nested skill check. What this means is that you roll a check for each skill involved and if any of them fail the action fails. If they all succeed the action succeeds.

To back flip down some stairs while shooting a fireball up the stairs you would need to pass both acrobatics and fire magic checks.

If a character is trying to do two things at once, juggling while doing a backflip for instance, just increase the difficulty. If a player is doing two things that are radically different, that is the apropriate time to make two skill checks. (Doing a backflip and casting a spell)

If a character wants to do two or more things that are both possible but not trivial at the same time, you might be wondering what to do. Which skill do you use? What affect does this have on the difficulty?

1. If both actions would be using the same skill or attribute, simply make the check using that and modify the difficulty to fit.
2. If the composite action resembles one action more than the other, use that skill and modify the difficulty to fit.
3. If one of the actions is dependent on the other, roll multiple checks sequentially and modify the difficulty of the later checks based on the results of the earlier checks.

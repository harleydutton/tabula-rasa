When a player disagrees with the difficulty of a check they can challenge the difficulty the storyteller has set. When a player challenges the difficulty of a check, this means they are asking the table to vote for what they think the difficulty should be. The storyteller's vote counts as 1.5. The purpose of this system is to deal with storytellers who are a little unfair some of the time, not make all checks **easy**. Each check can only have it's difficulty challenged once.

This belongs in the storyteller section, it should not be base rules. Instead this should be an option for storytellers who frequently get negative reactions to their difficulty rulings. This is intended as a communication framework, not as a common mechanic or a [[Checks and Balances]].

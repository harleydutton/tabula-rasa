Decide:
- The storyteller can introduce the event die whenever they want.
- Roll the event die with every check

Basically when a check is rolled and additional d6 is rolled. If this d6 comes up 1 something bad happens and if it comes up 6 something good happen.

it's probably easiest to just have the storyteller roll the event die.

effectively speaking, this makes Crit success and fail's independent of everything else in the check.

I like this system because it is simple. I dislike the notion of adding the even die to every check because that would be incredibly chaotic. I think having it be a part of weird checks in the storyteller section is appropriate, and having the storyteller use it at their discretion makes sense.

Inversely, it ties the storyteller's hands in some cases. I think adding it to combat and downtime might make sense and leaving it out of scene time rolls might make sense.

I think the point of this would be to introduce more chaos in a situation. In an instance like a battle this would be appropriate.

I think the storyteller advice here is to introduce the event die when:
- you want to introduce chaos, like for a pitched battle in a war
- there is potential for both a critical success and failure for an action

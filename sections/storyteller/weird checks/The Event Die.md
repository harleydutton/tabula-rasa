The [[Storyteller]] may choose to add the event die to a [[Checks|Check]]. It can be rolled either publicly or privately, either by the storyteller or one of the [[Player|Players]]. The storyteller chooses in both cases.

|Event Die|Meaning|
|-|-|
|1|something goes poorly|
|2-5|no additional effect|
|6|something goes well|

perhaps make this another section?

when to involve it:
- chaotic situations like conflict
- [[Checks]] that could go extra well or extra poorly independent of their [[Outcome]]
- every check
- when you want to stress out your players

---

should the positive and negative effects be bound to when the check is happening? no, or the privacy of the roll doesn't matter.

---

logistic options:
- use an identifiable die
	- first or last die in the dice software
- have another player roll it

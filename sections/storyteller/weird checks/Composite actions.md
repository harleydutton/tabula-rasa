If a character wants to do two or more things that are both possible but not trivial at the same time, you might be wondering what to do. Which skill do you use? What affect does this have on the difficulty?

1. If both actions would be using the same skill or attribute, simply make the check using that and modify the difficulty to fit.
2. If the composite action resembles one action more than the other, use that skill and modify the difficulty to fit.
3. If one of the actions is dependent on the other, roll multiple checks sequentially and modify the difficulty of the later checks based on the results of the earlier checks.

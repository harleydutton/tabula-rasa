[[worldbuilding interface]]

tabula rasa doesn't *need* to have an included worldbuilding framework because [[Setting]] doesn't need all those parts. the storyteller book might benefit from it. consider including one of these:
- GRAPES
- HERMETICS
- anthropology follows the religion backwards usually
- that one big framework with the compass
- a custom worldbuilding framework

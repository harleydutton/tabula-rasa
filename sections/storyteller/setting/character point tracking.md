the storyteller should keep track of group and all individual
this should be on the setting

players should keep track of group + individual - spent = current
this should be on the character sheet

everything except flavor can be traced backward to figure out how many character points have been spent. [[Consider]] splitting flavor up into items, traits and statuses. fresh characters should have no statuses so their items and traits should account for the rest of the character points.

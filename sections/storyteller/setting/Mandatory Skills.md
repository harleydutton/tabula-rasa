Mandatory Skills are those that every character receives from the given Setting. This is meant to represent the Skills that every character should naturally have access to like seeing, strength, and persuasion. There are some characters who will have Flavor that renders these skills useless or remove them entirely. The flavors blind and paralyzed come to mind.

Mandatory skills are Body, Mind, Spirit and Social. They are the most broad skills in each of their respective categories which are physical, mental, magical, and... social. These skills can be used to roll any check in their category but scale differently than every other skill. All characters get one level in each mandatory skill for free just in case they have to make a check they don't have an appropriate skill for.

Mandatory skills are skills every character _needs_ within the setting. They are listed at the top of the skills section in the setting. Add all of the mandatory skills to your character sheet.

mandatory skills (the attributes I have selected) are a necessary thing for the setting. I think I have chosen some good, though opinionated defaults. I suppose a storyteller could choose to change that though. This might be better in the storyteller section rather than the setting section.

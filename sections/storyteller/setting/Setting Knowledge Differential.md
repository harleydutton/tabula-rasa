If you are trying to play in the world of Star Wars you will fail. Your players will likely not know the world as well as you do. This knowledge differential will cause you to make your players feel like they are "playing wrong". Furthermore, playing strictly in the world of Star Wars, your setting cannot grow and players cannot play what they want which is the point of this system. You must allow your setting to change and grow. Don't play in the Star Wars setting, play in a setting *like* Star Wars. This also needs to be communicated to players so that when one of them knows the source material, like Star Wars, better than you do they understand that nobody is "doing it wrong" because this isn't Star Wars, it's *like* Star Wars.

A common problem with [[Skills]] is that I have a hard time defining how big they should be in general. Should a character that wants to blast some fuckers take `fireball`, `fire magic`, or `elemental magic`? The [[Spirit]] [[Attribute]] is roughly equivalent to `magic` which represents the upper bound of scope.

I think presenty I want to say that skills must take the lowest possible scope available to accoplish the thing. Sailing would be a problematic exception though.

the storyteller should keep track of group and all individual
this should be on the setting

players should keep track of group + individual - spent = current
this should be on the character sheet

everything except flavor can be traced backward to figure out how many character points have been spent.

This probably doesn't need to be a section because I can do it as implicit stuff on the setting doc or character sheet.

- examples of specific skills and flavor will be monospace in-line
- section specific keywords will be in bold
- sections will be referenced using [links](https://github.com/harleydutton/Tabula-Rasa/blob/develop/tabula-rasa.md#legend)
- larger examples will be quoted and appear under the relevant section with no header.

This is a list of formatting choices I have made throughout this document to better inform you, dear reader:
- section specific **keywords** will be in bold
- things–like interjections–will be hyphenated
- The first example of each abbreviation (ABRV) in a section will be in parenthesis
- placing _emphasis_ on words will be done with italics
- sections will be referenced using links
- examples of specific skills and flavor will be monospace in-line
- larger examples will be block-quoted and appear under the relevant section with no header

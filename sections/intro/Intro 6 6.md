Tabula Rasa is a rules-light, generic, table-top roleplaying game that allows and encourages players to create their own skills, powers, lore, etc. and easily add them to the game world.

It also includes a worldbuilding framework to more easily allow the storyteller to create a setting. Settings are short, standardized, and shareable descriptions of a single place within a world. The intent is that settings can be used to quickly understand a part of the world such that a player can create a character or the storyteller can create an adventure.

The role playing system is generic so it will work with any setting produced by the worldbuilding framework. The rules are minimal meaning you and your group should be able to create characters and start playing very quickly!

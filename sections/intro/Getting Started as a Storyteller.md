You will need a few things:
- [[Story]] so [[storybuilding framework]]
- [[Setting]] so [[Setting Creation]]
- probably NPCs so [[Character Creation]] but the special kind tailored to the type of game the storyteller is going to make so actually [[Non-Player Character Creation]]
- to understand how the game works so [[Checks]], [[Descriptors]], [[Skills]]
- to understand some pitfalls that come with running this system so [[Limits]], storytelling tips, [[Weird checks]], [[Weird checks]], etc.

[[Storyteller sections design checklist]]
[[worldbuilding framework]]
[[storybuilding framework]]
[[Getting Started as a Player]]

neither of these work well with the existing wiki/digital garden thing I have going on.

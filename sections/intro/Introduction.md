Tabula Rasa is a worldbuilding framework and a rules-light, generic roleplaying game that lets players create their own skills and add to the setting easily.

The worldbuilding framework produces a Setting. Settings are short, standardized, and easily shareable descriptions of a single place within a world. The intent is that Settings can be used to quickly understand a part of the world such that a player can create a Character or the Storyteller can create an Adventure.

The roleplaying system is generic so it will work with any Setting produced by the worldbuilding framework. The rules are minimal meaning you and your group should be able to create any character imaginable within the Setting and start playing very quickly!

To start an Adventure you will need a few things. First and most important, your group will need a Setting so they can do character creation. You can use one of the included Settings, find one online, or make your own by filling out the Setting template. Otherwise you need paper, pencils, six-sided dice, and players. A printer and having your adventure planned out are both highly recommended. Once you have these things proceed to the Character Creation section.
<!-- the bit below needs to be written into the bit above -->
1. The storyteller should visit the [setting](# setting) to create a setting for the story to take place in. 
2. Players should visit the [character creation](#character-creation) section.
3. The storyteller should head over to the [making an adventure](#making-an-adventure) section if they need help with that.
<!--I think a map, a battlegrid, tokens, and cards might also be helpful depending the other rules I include-->

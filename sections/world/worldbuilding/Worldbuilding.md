Worldbuilding is the process of creating a fictional [[World]] in which to tell stories and roleplay characters. Developing a history, culture, ecology, and any number of other [[Worldbuilding Elements]] with purpose is key to creating a coherent world. Alternatively, there exists plenty of [[Source Material]] like books, films, and games already with worlds you can use.

In either case, you will need to fill out a [[World Sheet]] with sensible values. This is a guide for doing so:

- [[Tick Length]] is how long you want turns of conflict to take. For a sword or gun fight a second is a reasonable value. This should be increased for vehicle and social combat.
- [[Default Delay]] represents the variance between character speed. A value of 10 is reasonable for most games and makes the math easy. This should be increased if you want characters to have more similar turn lengths.
- [[Domain]] is what portion of the world a world sheet represents. If you are drawing from source material this should already be defined. Otherwise, choose area you plan on describing to your players when you start your story and expand it or create new world sheets for new areas as needed.
- The [[Experience Tracker|Group Experience]] value on the experience tracker is the starting [[Experience]] that will be available at character creation. I recommend 50 for characters of moderate competence.
- The [[Store]] is a list of goods and [[Prices]] for things that can be bought and sold within the world. First write down all the items you have created or pulled from your source material. Once you have a decent list, begin pricing them based the source material or how available you want them to be. Keep in mind that the store is intended to grow as you and your players add things.
- The list of [[Available Skills]] should be pulled from source material if you are using it Otherwise you can create a few to set the tone for the skills [[Player|Players]] will inevitably make.

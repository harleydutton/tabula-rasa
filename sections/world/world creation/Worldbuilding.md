Worldbuilding is the process of creating a fictional place for telling stories in.

- [[World Purpose]]
- [[Source Material]]
- [[Worldbuilding Elements]]
Depending on the purpose of a world, other [[Worldbuilding Elements]] are worth looking at.

As a [[Storyteller]], you should fill out a [[World Sheet]] with values of your choice. Defaults are listed here:

---

- [[Available Backgrounds]]
	- backgrounds should be at least partially created by players so you don't have to fully populate this, though you should have a couple backgrounds here to inspire them. I would suggest things like species, birthright, personal history, and career. potentially ask your players what they want to see in the game and add that.
- [[Available Skills]]
	- skills should be at least partially created by the players so you don't have to fully populate this, though you should have a couple skills here to inspire them. I would suggest skills analogous to fighting, persuasion, trade, skilled labor, unskilled labor, crime, medicine, intellectualism, etc. potentially ask your players what they want and add that.
- [[Tick Length and Default Delay]] 10 ticks
	- a 10 tick default leaves room for meaningful improvement without making it too easy to reduce delay to 1 as a speed of 9 would be required and that would be fucking expensive. 1 second is a reasonable amount of time for a tick for most games without super-speed or vehicle combat. changing the default delay messes with turn delay differentials.
- [[Domain]] city/country/planet
	- at this point this largely defines how far off the rails the players would have to go to see a part of the world not planned out on this specific world sheet
- [[Experience Tracker]] starting group experience at 40 gives enough experience for a couple skills between 3-5 and average level of 2 in attributes/speed/wealth. I recommend giving out one experience per game night played, an experience for each objective accomplished, and an experience for each instance of good roleplaying
- [[Limits]] for limits you should start by disallowing things that break the vibe of the game you want to run and things you know you can't manage well
- [[Store]] the store should contain tools (including vehicles and weapons), necessities, and luxuries to start with and progress from there. potentially ask your players what they want and add that.

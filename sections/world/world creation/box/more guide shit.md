There are a few levels of decisions that get made during worldbuilding. The first level is what you want to accomplish with your world i.e. the [[World Purpose]]. The second level is to look over the list of meta decisions you can make about worldbuilding in my [[Soft Worldbuilding Guide]] and choose a subset of those to prioritize. The third level is to actually choose [[Worldbuilding Elements]] to actually support the first two levels. You should be sharing most of the third level with your players and should be prepared to do so in some fashion. You can keep the first and second hidden or not at your discretion.

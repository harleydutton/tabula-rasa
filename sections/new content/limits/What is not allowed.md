This idea behind this section is that at [[Setting Creation]] the [[Storyteller]] chooses categories of  shit they don't want in their [[Setting]]/[[Story]] and makes it harder to get. They can ban it outright, make it expensive; obscure; unique; or stigmatic, or put a limit on it like a secondary resource cost or cooldown. At one point this was called [[Limits]] but it was intended as a per-[[Skill|skill]] solution. That doesn't scale well so I have updated the intent to be setting wide.

This section is a multiple-choice questionnaire of common problematic elements within stories and whether or not each thing exists within the setting. This might be things like resurrection, undodgeable attack actions, and fast, long-range communications. Each element on this list should have a concept and a circleable descriptor indicating its availability within the setting. The storyteller should circle one descriptor for each and consider adding more entries. Sometimes entire game systems like crafting will be removed and this is intended.

- Skills the players make need to have descriptive names. You should be able to tell what a skill does by reading the name and maybe the description.
- Consult the [[big Limits|limits]] section of the [[Setting]] and think up a skill within those bounds and run the idea by your [[Storyteller|storyteller]]. If they approve it it will be added to the setting (possibly with new limits) after which characters can take and level the skill like any other.
- Players are encouraged to suggest additions to the list of skills on the setting. 
- Dedicated characters can also create new skills and add them to the setting--once again, only with storyteller approval.

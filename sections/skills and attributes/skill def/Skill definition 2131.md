Definition: a skill is something a character can do and more importantly fail at. casting waterbreathing spell vs breathing under water with gills.
new skills start at a level equal to the exp spent on them? new skills need to be apporved by dm. new skills can be leveled up with exp with dm approval.
skills level up once they have been used a number of times equal to their level? when they accumulate succeses and fails equal to level? just one of those?
Skills the players make need to have descriptive names. You should be able to tell what a skill does by reading the name and maybe the description.
A good heuristic for skills might be that they end in "ing" or "ation". Figure out what parts of speech/tense these are.

Skills represent the stuff a [[Character]] can *do*. This is accomplished by making a [[Checks|Check]] related to the skill. Each skill has a name and a level, with higher levels being better. 

Skills are leveled up using the [[Linear Scaling]] chart and characters can get new ones from the [[Setting Document]] at [[Character Creation]] or [[Downtime]]. If the setting document does not have a skill you want, you should [[New Content Negotiation|Negotiate New Content]] with your [[Storyteller]].

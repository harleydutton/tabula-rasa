Setting manifest of skills (probably send to setting/ and decide later whether or not that needs to be a thing)

- [[Content]]/[[big Limits]] will have a list of skills characters can take that are appropriate to the setting. To take a skill simply add it to your character sheet in the skills section and pay CP to level it up to at least level 1. As defined in the [[big Limits]] section you may also have to pay [[Hooks]]/[[Boon]]. 
- Characters may take levels in any skills listed on the setting document unless it wouldn't make sense for them to do so. 
- Skills are listed on the setting. This should include all of the skills the players or storyteller have added to the setting.

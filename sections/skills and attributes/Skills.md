new skills stuff (send to content/ negotiation section)
- new skills start at a level equal to the exp spent on them? new skills need to be apporved by dm. new skills can be leveled up with exp with dm approval.
- Skills the players make need to have descriptive names. You should be able to tell what a skill does by reading the name and maybe the description.
- Consult the [[big Limits|limits]] section of the [[Setting]] and think up a skill within those bounds and run the idea by your [[Storyteller|storyteller]]. If they approve it it will be added to the setting (possibly with new limits) after which characters can take and level the skill like any other.
- Players are encouraged to suggest additions to the list of skills on the setting. 
- Your setting document will have a list of a few example skills you can take that are appropriate for the setting. (this is more [[Theme]] than available skills)

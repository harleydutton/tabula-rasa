Attributes are very similar to skills with a few exceptions. Like skills, attributes can be used to roll checks but unlike skills attributes are as broad in [scope](https://github.com/harleydutton/Tabula-Rasa/blob/develop/tabula-rasa.md#scope) as they can be. Like skills, attributes can be leveled up using CP but they are far more expensive. Unlike skills, attributes act as a character's physical, mental, spiritual, and social health. Furthermore, attributes are often used defensively when no other skill would apply. Lastly, attributes can and often are used for perception checks.

Attributes Body, Mind, Spirit and Social. They are similar to skills but have meaningful differences. First, every character gets the first level of each attribute for free. Second, attributes cost significantly more CP to level up than skills do. Third, attributes are broad and if a character does not have an applicable skill they can roll an attribute. For this reason attributes are frequently used as defensive skills and for perception checks. Lastly, attributes represent a character's physical, mental, spiritual, and social health. This is discussed in more depth in the Damage section.

these are all attributes [[Wealth]][[Speed]][[Body]][[Mind]][[Spirit]][[Presence]]
[[balance decisions]] the CP cost to level attributes is exponential. The cp cost is desired level squared. If leveling up an attribute multiple times the level up cost for each intermediary level must be paid.

[[design decisions]] should I include the attribute leveling table? (X(X+1)(2X+1)/6)-1 CP

The attributes are [[Mind]], [[Body]], [[Spirit]], [[Presence]] though I think I want to rename the social one. maybe `Communication`, `comms`, `Grace`, or `Graces`?

Attributes are [[Skill]] of the highest [[sections/storyteller/setting/Scope]]

The attributes are [[Body]], [[Mind]], [[Spirit]], [[Presence]], [[Wealth]], and [[Speed]].

The attributes are [[Mind]], [[Body]], [[Spirit]], and [[Presence]].
Attributes scale quadratically:

The first level of each attribute is free.

so if i want to run skills without attributes there will be one major problem. what happens when a character wants to arm wrestle but they don't have the "arm wrestling" or "athletics" skills or a strength attribute. They probably have a "swordfighting" skill or some such but that doesn't apply to the contested check that is the arm wrestling match. They should be kinda good at this kind of thing, right? it just doesn't get represented well. I suppose you could have attributes as incredibly generic skills. perhaps you always get a disadvantage on them? nah, but i do like the idea of having attributes as fairly generic skill checks. it might be a good idea to map out all the usual roleplaying actions and figure out which ones need a check.

Attributes are intended to be what you roll if you don't have an apt skill. They have the broadest scope and should be collectively appropriate for any roll. By attributes I mean [[Mind]], [[Body]], [[Spirit]], and [[Presence]]

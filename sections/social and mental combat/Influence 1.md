When one character uses a skill to make another character do something the first character is exerting their influence. These situations can quickly break the game or make it unenjoyable unless there is counter play. This section defines a system for resolving these situations. For this section the salesman will be the character exerting influence and the mark will be the target of their influence.

### **Social Influence**

Social influence is when the **salesman** uses their demeanor and way with words to convince the **mark** to do their will. The skills persuasion, seduction, bartering, intimidation and of course the social attribute are the usual suspects.

#### **Difficulty**

Before the salesman's influence check is made the storyteller should check the mark's motivations. Social influence checks are affected by the mark's [motivations](https://github.com/harleydutton/Tabula-Rasa/blob/develop/tabula-rasa.md#motivations) as well as flavor.

#### **Resistance**

Social influence is typically not resisted unless the character has a reason to do so. PCs may always choose to resist social influence. When social influence is resisted the mandatory skill social, or a more apt skill, is used to roll a check. The mark's [motivations](https://github.com/harleydutton/Tabula-Rasa/blob/develop/tabula-rasa.md#motivations) can have an effect on this check as well.

A guard has obvious reasons to not tell you about the secret entrance and should resist. A child has little reason not to carry your message to the mayor when you ask him.

### **Mental Influence**

Mental influence is when a character uses magic or some other plot device to subvert the will of the mark. The best example is mind control but others are madness, illusions, and emotion magic.

#### **Difficulty**

The mark's motivations are typically of little relevance in situations of mental influence. The mark's code of honor doesn't really come into play when they are told "go jump out a window."

#### **Resistance**

Mental influence is almost always resisted. When the salesman uses mind control and tells the mark "Give me your wallet.", the mark probably doesn't have a relevant motivation to influence their resistance roll but will definitely want to resist. Usually the mark resists by rolling a check with the mandatory skill mind or a more apt skill. Typically this check goes unmodified unless magic items or flavor are involved.

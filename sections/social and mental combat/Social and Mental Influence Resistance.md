Social influence is typically not resisted unless the character has a reason to do so. When social influence is resisted the attribute `social`, or a more apt skill, is used to roll a check. The **mark's** [motivations](#motivations) can have an effect on this check as well.

> A guard has obvious reasons to not tell you about the secret entrance and should resist. A child has little reason not to carry your message to the mayor when you ask him.

<!-- Motivations should only effect one of the resistance and influence rolls. Not both. Do testing to determine which makes more sense. -->

Mental influence is almost always resisted. When the **salesman** uses `mind control` and tells the **mark** "Give me your wallet.", the **mark** probably doesn't have a relevant motivation to influence their resistance roll but will definitely want to resist. Usually the **mark** resists by rolling a check with the `mind` attribute or a relevant skill. Typically this check goes unmodified unless magic items or flavor are involved.

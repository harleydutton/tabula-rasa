comment: handled in money and items; remove

Money is represented as flavor in Tabula. Character points can be converted into minor purchases. Money-flavor represents a character's liquid assets or the stuff they have for trade. Money-flavor can be aliased to whatever the currency for you game is: `gold coins`, `spacebucks`, `dollars`, `bullets`, `litres (of water)`, etc. If you want to know more go visit the [Money](https://github.com/harleydutton/Tabula-Rasa/blob/develop/tabula-rasa.md#money-1) section. Typically money can be spent on things on the settings store as long as you find a store selling that thing in-game.

I am thinking i want to have a chart somewhere that handles things like store prices and loot by asking the dm to define one unit of currency and then derive all the prices in their world based on some percentage or multiple of this. this would also give the DM a good time to think about what things are available or not and what things are scarce or plentiful and adjust prices and availability accordingly. Talk about money in the doc as AUCs (arbitrary units of currency). really I think this should be a part of the "settings" section.
If i decide to give items a level/numeric value it would make sense to have them be orders of magnitude more and less expensive based on those numbers.

In Tabula money has been abstracted away as annoying bookkeeping. Many common items will be effectively free. When you actually have money it will usually be the flavor minor purchase or less commonly a major purchase. These purchases can be roleplayed as being whatever the native currency of the world is be it gold coins, bank notes, or space-bucks. To understand how these purchases will spend take a look at the store chart on your setting.

This is the store from Sequoia, the example setting.

|   |   |   |   |

In Tabula, money is very abstract so as to avoid tedium and allow each setting to have it's own currency. Items will be listed in the setting store with a price of **free**, **cheap**, **expensive** or **unobtainable** though this cannot be comprehensive. Money can be gotten by converting CP or boons into purchases, and when it is spent it will refresh at the beginning of downtime. Money and Items are both flavor.

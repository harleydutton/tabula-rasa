lent items will count toward someone else's wealth and not your own exactly as though you have given it to them, the only difference being the expectation by at least one party that it will be returned.

as newly imagined with wealth, liquid currency and assets/expenses, this doesn't make sense. does it though?

If you let another players character borrow one of your items, it still counts as your item and affects your item counts and purchasing power and not theirs. You cannot break this system by giving all of your items to other characters because your purchases won't refresh.

Think through it and pick one of these two.

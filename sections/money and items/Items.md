comment: [[item flavor comment]]

Unlike most other roleplaying games which have extensive tables for equipment, in Tabula I have opted to represent equipment as flavor. This means that armor, weapons, tools, vehicles, and treasure should be represented as flavor. Typically equipment will modify the difficulty of checks with relevant skills sometimes reducing the difficulty from `impossible` and effectively granting a character new abilities.

Items are a type of flavor that can be bought using money. When tracking them on your character sheet, keep track of their price. Put an F, C, or E next to each item to denote them as free, cheap, or expensive respectively.

Items are a character's material posessions. Items are represented on a character sheet as a list of short, descriptive names with quantity where appliccable.

Items are a type of flavor that can be bought, found, looted, lost, made, destroyed, broken, sold, borrowed, lent, etc. A unit of minor currency can be used to buy cheap items. Similarly a unit of major currency can be used to buy expensive items. When tracking items on your character sheet, keep track of their price. To do this, put an F, C, or E next to each item to denote them as free, cheap, or expensive respectively. The setting store should give you an idea what is available within the world and what it will cost. Individual stores within the story almost never match up with what is available in the entire world of the setting.

Wealth is guaranteed stat like speed and attributes that represents a character's [[big Hidden Information 1]].  [[problems]] i think this is meant to link to "money and items"

At [[Downtime]], the sum of a [[Character 1]]s [[Currency]], [[Assets]], and [[Expenses]] will trend back towards their wealth. 

A character's method of currency [[Income]] is a big part of what their wealth is or the shape it takes. I'm not sure if I want wealth to be a number or a bunch of flavor yet. It needs to be used as a number. It probably makes the most sense to just have it be a number.



Dumping this here from temp because I think this is going to be the top level section:
Was somewhere in the process of reworking [[big Hidden Information 1]]. Could I rename it? It involves liquid currency, assets and expenses. Rename the section "wealth" perhaps? This is the stat characters would be leveling.
Assets and Expenses go together.
liquid currency =  wealth - (assets + expenses)
liquid currency should trend toward this formula 
`liquid currency =  wealth - (assets + expenses)`

Setting specific currency is currency is money. Should I remove one of money/currency from that chain? It's more natural to talk about as money.

In Tabula, money is very abstract to avoid tedium and allow each setting to have its own currency. Wealth is [[big Character master copy]] stat representing the total material posessions and liquid currency a character *should* posess.

[[problems]] what if there isn't a currenncy? barter obviously becomes a thing but the *should* part of wealth breaks down. I'm going to say the character acquires flavor the storyteller deems reasonable based on their character's gethering skills or something like that. Maybe they deal in favors, idk.

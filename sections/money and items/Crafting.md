previously i advocated for magnitude of success. this was likely due to "the crafting problem". if you don't have magnitude of success for crafting then any sword a blacksmith makes is as good as any other sword in the universe. magnitude of success solved this problem by generating a number you could tack onto the created equipment.
I have though of an alternative to this (crappy) solution to "the crafting problem". Instead of determining the quality of the sword after it is done decide on the quality before the roll is made, apply an equivalently sized bonus or penalty and then make the roll. after that it is simple success/failure. the dm can determine if what is created is anything other than garbage upon failure.
It is worth noting that the crafting problem goes away when you remove the numeric values from combat.

In Tabula, crafting an item is just a skill check. Describe what you want and how you plan on using your crafting skill to get it, ask the storyteller what the difficulty is, and make the roll. If you succeed you get the desired item, likely with some narrative flair. If you fail you do not get what you asked for, any materials and time put into the crafting roll are lost, and it is possible something bad happens.

Crafting can be used to make items. The upside to crafting is that it gives players more flexibility than buying. The downside is that it takes longer and has the potential to fail. Crafting is useful because you make custom items, items that are otherwise unobtainable, items that have never existed, or just whatever you need in the moment. To start, purchase materials of a similar quality to the item you want to end up with. Next, as usual, propose an item to your storyteller. If they accept, describe how you make it and make a roll. The difficulty of the crafting check is determined by tools used, time taken, material price, and the item being made. If you succeed, you get your item. If you don't, the materials are lost.

Crafting can be used to make items. The upside to crafting is that it gives players more flexibility than buying. Crafting is useful because you can make custom items, items that are otherwise locally unavailable, items that have never existed, or just whatever you need at the moment. The downsides are that it takes longer and has the potential to fail. To start, purchase or gather materials. Next, as usual, propose an item to your storyteller. If they accept, describe how you make it and make a roll. The difficulty of the crafting check is determined by tools used, time taken, material price, and the value of the item being made. If you succeed, you get the item you were attempting to craft. If you don't, the materials are lost, and if you are out of materials you will have to try again when your currency has refreshed and you can afford new ones.

Purchasing power will get you setting specific currency when you acquire it and when it refreshes. In the example setting, Sequoia, one unit of minor currency is represented by one finger sized chunk of amber. Similarly, one unit of major currency is represented by one knuckle sized shard of aether. What a unit of major or minor currency represents is arbitrary and will usually differ between settings. This system makes no effort to establish a conversion rate between major and minor currency. Currency can be spent on goods and services.

In Sequoia, the included setting,  there are two popular currencies. Amber is commonly traded in chunks about the size of a finger. Typically amber is used to purchase cheap things like food, lodging, or entertainment. Aether is traded in small shards about the size of a knuckle. One shard of aether commands a high price and can be used to buy expensive things like vehicles, land, medicine, or education.

Currency is a generic name for whatever the money in the [[sections/setting/Setting]] is called. That said, it will  always spend the same and one unit of currency can pay for one "cheap" item.

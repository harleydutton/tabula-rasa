If you create a skill with appropriate scope that is just too powerful for the setting or story (most magic skills) your storyteller may inflict a few limiting factors upon the skill you have proposed or your character.

@Storyteller: A few good limiting factors are timing restrictions(requires multiple turns in combat, cannot be done in combat, takes multiple days, etc.), resource costs (add a mana bar, minor purchases, major purchases, etc.), context restrictions (must have line of sight, must have eye contact, must be touching the target, must have a piece of the target, etc.), and cooldowns (AUTs or turns, once per combat, once per day, refreshes randomly, etc.). If you cannot balance a skill, [veto](#veto) it.

[[Problem]] according to ethan, describing round/turn based game actions with the word cooldowns is "unhinged"

at one point i recommended having the DM nerf skills while they were being made. give them a mana cost, or a cooldown, or make them take a long time or whatever to help balance them. this is a good time to say that skills should have a type of action associated with them (major, minor, reaction, etc.) and this should be determined at skill creation.
most of the time limiting factors will need to come out for "magic" skills. a cooldown (recharges on 5 or 6 of 1d6 OR one use per day OR mana), a range restriction (you have to touch them OR be able to see them OR something), or a speed restriction (ritual magic that takes anywhere from a few minutes to a few days and cannot be done in combat).

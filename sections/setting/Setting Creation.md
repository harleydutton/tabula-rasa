As a [[Storyteller]], you should fill out a [[Setting Document]] with values of your choice. Defaults are listed here:
- [[Experience Tracking|Group Experience]] of 40, want enough for 2 in each attribute, a couple skills level 3-5, and maybe some speed/wealth
- [[Setting Delay]] of 10, lower numbers increase speed differentials, higher numbers decrease them, warning on low number with high experience
- [[Available Skills]] appropriate to your setting, possibly generated by the [[Player|Players]]
- Add [[Items]] to the [[Store]] and give them [[Prices]], possibly generated by players
- initiate [[New Content Negotiation]] and ask your players what they want in the game
- whatever [[Limits]] you feel comfortable with for the combination of setting, story, and players
- choose a [[Currency]], this is probably the least important decision.
- consider adding some stuff but players will probably make most of the [[Background|Backgrounds]]

this should be a how to, potentially with defaults. it should go into a fair bit of detail for how to make each part. I have tried to add a bullet point for each thing I want to discuss.

this is for the [[Storyteller]] to do and as such the [[Getting Started as a Storyteller]] page should link here.

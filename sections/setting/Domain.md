- how much of the setting/world the setting document describes.
- it should answer the question of "are there other places"
- presented to the players
- settings usually wind up growing and can start from almost nothing
- if a place you travel to is sufficiently different from the existing setting/world you may need a new setting document with some number of parts having new stuff in them
- a settings domain can change over time
- possibly best represented in negative space i.e earth, not heaven, hell, space, the ocean, or anything else like that.

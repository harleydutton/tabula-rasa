A common reason for an addition to a setting to be rejected is because of theme. Don't try to play a wizard in a non-magic setting. Don't try to play a jedi in a medieval setting. Sure there are storytellers who will jump at that but try to stay within the themes outlined in the setting document.

A common reason for an addition to a setting to be rejected is because of its theme. Most commonly, goofy additions will be rejected when a storyteller wants to tell a “serious” story. Sometimes naming your character Reggie Fuckhammer or being a vampire that shapeshifts into a seagull or platypus will clash a little too much with the setting. Sure there are storytellers who will jump at that but try to stay within the themes outlined in the setting document.

Each setting has a theme. It might be the wild west with cowpokes getting into brawls and lobbing dynamite off of trains. It might be an epic swords and sorceries adventure. It might be a modern day espionage story with lots of gunfights and back alley deals. It might be the far flung future with spaceships battling around every asteroid. The point is that players should try to match their characters to the theme of the setting as well as they can. Usually the storyteller doesn't enjoy telling you you cannot play a wizard in the story about space pirates.

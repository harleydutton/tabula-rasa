Skills represent things a character can do. Each character within a setting has access to the s same set of skills. Any character can learn these skills with storyteller approval either at character creation or during the story. Players are encouraged to suggest additions to the list of skills on the setting. A few examples of skills are sword-fighting, necromancy, seduction, and piloting. Skills can be purchased with CP at character creation and during the story by any character. Characters do not need to have every skill.

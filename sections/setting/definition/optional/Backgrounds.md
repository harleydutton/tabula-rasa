[[problem]] I don't think I plan to go forward with backgrounds. Might be a useful example of flavor or stuff a storyteller can add to a setting though.

A list of potential backgrounds could be useful. In a fantasy setting you will want to include all of the magical species here. If you feel the need to balance the versatility of magic out by giving it a downside you could include “magic user” as a background and use it to gatekeep and give downsides to magic. It is also worth listing which backgrounds are incompatible here. Typically players will want to add to this list.

Wizard - must be 30+ and a virgin
Vampire - catches on fire in the sun, needs to drink blood, pretty, strong, ageless etc.
Goblin - Bad reputation, short, ugly, don’t live long
Robot - Immune to electric and mental damage, cannot heal but can be repaired with crafting checks. Can modify body and knowledge easily. Needs to charge, doesn’t need to eat or sleep. Cannot be a wizard.

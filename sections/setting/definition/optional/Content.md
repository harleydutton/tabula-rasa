this should be a list of available skills and flavor (items and the normal kind).
limits should (including hooks) should be marked.


[[design decisions]][[organization decisions]] In an abstract sense this section compliments the [[big Limits]] section. The setting's limits describe what is banned/restricted within the world and most other things are implicitly allowed. The store is intended more to set the tone, create expectations for what NPCs will be like, and be an example of character parts that will fit into the setting. Should this section be a part of Limits? Flavor store, skill store, flavor limits, skill limits.

[[naming decisions]] this used to be named "the store" but it needed to support skills and all flavor, not just items. I think content or source material is a fine name.

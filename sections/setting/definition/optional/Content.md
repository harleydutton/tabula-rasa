this should be a list of available skills and flavor (items and the normal kind).
limits should (including hooks) should be marked.

In an abstract sense this section compliments the [[big Limits]] section. The setting's limits describe what is banned/restricted within the world and most other things are implicitly allowed. Things that actually exist per the player/storyteller are what I would call content. The store is intended more to set the tone, create expectations for what NPCs will be like, and be an example of character parts that will fit into the setting. Should this section be a part of Limits? Flavor store, skill store, flavor limits, skill limits.

Limits define what is *not* allowed in the [[Setting]]. Content will describe what *exists* in the setting. The remainder, what is allowed but does not exist is covered by [[Skill Creation]] and [[Getting Backgrounds]] and [[Item Creation]], all of which can probably be made more general with [[Negotiating New Content]]
- [[Background|Backgrounds]]
- [[Skill|Skills]]
- [[Store]]

Character Points, also known as CP, are a resource used by players throughout the game to take new Skills and Flavor and level up existing skills. The suggested starting character points for a setting is basically a recommendation for starting level. If characters start with 60 CP rather than 50 they will be a little stronger on average. There is usually a positive correlation between the number of mandatory skills in a setting and the starting CP.

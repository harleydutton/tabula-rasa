A Setting is a template for worldbuilding. It includes a description of the world, the normal speed of characters in the world for combat, the amount of character points new characters in the world start with, a list of Mandatory Skills, and a list of Skills common within the Setting. The description includes the technological level, magic, history, spatial/geographic scope, flora, fauna, biomes, natural resources, items, culture, store, etc. of the World. To be mechanically playable a Setting needs an Action Delay, starting character points, a list of Mandatory Skills, a list of common skills, and a general description. Splitting the description into the cultural and the physical aspects of the world can be helpful. Creating a store is a good idea in most cases (unless you're a communist).

## **Action Delay**

The default Action Delay for the Setting is what all new characters in the Setting will start with. Typically this is 10. This will guarantee that most of the characters in the Setting are at about the same speed in scenes where timing matters like combat and chases. Because it is just a default and can be modified it also allows for some characters to be faster or slower than the average character.

  
  

## **Character Points**

Character Points, also known as CP, are a resource used by players throughout the game to take new Skills and Flavor and level up existing skills. The suggested starting character points for a setting is basically a recommendation for starting level. If characters start with 60 CP rather than 50 they will be a little stronger on average. There is usually a positive correlation between the number of mandatory skills in a setting and the starting CP.

## **Skills**

Skills represent things a character can do. Each character within a setting has access to the s same set of skills. Any character can learn these skills with storyteller approval either at character creation or during the story. Players are encouraged to suggest additions to the list of skills on the setting. A few examples of skills are sword-fighting, necromancy, seduction, and piloting. Skills can be purchased with CP at character creation and during the story by any character. Characters do not need to have every skill.

Available skills can be purchased with CP at character creation and during the story by any character. Characters do not need to have every available skill.

## **Technology and Magic Descriptions**

A couple of initial questions players usually have when they are making characters in a new setting are "Is there magic?" and "What is the technological level?" and for this reason the answers to these questions should be on the setting. They are commonly asked, important, and usually easy to answer. If there is any fictitious magic in the setting it should be described here.

## **Store**

First off _the_ store doesn't really exist after character creation. Characters will have to go to stores in the story to purchase things listed on _the_ store. Going to _a_ store within the story rather than _the_ store will drastically affect what is available for sale and maybe even what it is legal to trade. This is all subject to DTMS checks and storyteller approval after character creation. Anyway, _the_ store is set up as a series of priced columns. The flavor section describes the purchasing power of various pieces of flavor-money, also known as purchases. The columns should be "Trivial", "Minor", "Major", and "impossible". Trivial purchases are effectively free, minor purchases are worth one CP, major purchases need to be roleplayed for or a deal needs to be struck, and impossible purchases are typically too expensive to ever purchase. Impossible purchases may become available through roleplaying. The columns of the store should all have things characters can purchase in/under them as reference points.

Trivial purchases are things like food, beer, candy, ammo, clothes, or entertainment. A minor purchase would be something that costs more a gun, car, specialized tool, computer, or medicine. Major purchases would be things like houses, companies, famous art, fancy cars, or a college education. Some impossible purchases would be space shuttles, whole countries, or world-famous art.

## **Tone**

It is typically a good idea to set expectations for the tone of the story such that people have the same expectations for the game and those expectations are met. It can ruin a horror campaign to have a bunch of goofy shit happening all the time. It can ruin a serious campaign to have a character named reginald fuck-hammer. Similarly it can ruin a goofy space-romp to have a character with a depressing or sinister history.

## **Social Description**

The social description for the setting should describe what the people of the setting are like and what they have done. This will be things like important places, institutions, cultural events, and historic events. This will also include the races/peoples/cultures within the setting and the countries and governments they have formed.

## **Physical Description**

The physical description for the setting should describe what the land itself is like (assuming there is land). This would be things like geography, weather, plants, and animals. This should also include scope; how large an area does this description cover? A city? A country? A continent? A planet? A map will supplement this description nicely. The spatial scope can be the entire known universe or just the part the characters are in right now. A rough idea of how big it is will always help players wrap their heads around it though.

## **Theme**

Each setting has a theme. It might be the wild west with cowpokes getting into brawls and lobbing dynamite off of trains. It might be an epic swords and sorceries adventure. It might be a modern day espionage story with lots of gunfights and back alley deals. It might be the far flung future with spaceships battling around every asteroid. The point is that players should try to match their characters to the theme of the setting as well as they can. Usually the storyteller doesn't enjoy telling you you cannot play a wizard in the story about space pirates.

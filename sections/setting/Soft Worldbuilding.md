I define soft worldbuilding as all the worldbuilding decisions that are more relevant to the story than to the mechanical aspect of character creation. Soft worldbuilding is all the descriptions that make a world feel alive. If you need help with soft worldbuilding would suggest looking at my [[Soft Worldbuilding Guide]].

There are a few levels of decisions that get made during soft worldbuilding. The first level is what you want to accomplish with your world i.e. the [[World Value Function]]. The second level is to look over the list of meta decisions you can make about worldbuilding in my [[Soft Worldbuilding Guide]] and choose a subset of those to prioritize. The third level is to actually choose [[Worldbuilding Elements]] to actually support the first two levels. You should be sharing most of the third level with your players and should be prepared to do so in some fashion. You can keep the first and second hidden or not at your discretion.

### worldbuilding
i would like to provide a number of canned settings with Tabula that a group can read through quickly and get started roleplaying in. I would also like to add some kind of framework that when filled in would create similarly usable settings. a settings purpose in this context is only to describe it to the players such that they have a feel for the world and can begin roleplaying in it. it is not intended to be an exhaustive history, species catalog, spellbook, item dump, etc. it should however describe all of these things in minimal detail. what does an average character's flavor look like in this setting? what is common flavor. etc.

Available skills are those that are present in the setting but not everyone has. They can be rare or common like surgery and driving are in modern times. The point is that not _every_ character has them but most characters are able to learn these skills. A few more modern-day examples are cooking, driving, computer programming, basketball, and surgery.

Available skills are those listed on the setting. This should include all of the skills the players or storyteller have added to the setting. These skills are available within the setting to any character passing a DTMS check and can be purchased as normal.

The rest of the skills are those that are common within the setting and you can take any of them you can afford. Players can also propose to the storyteller that skills be added to the setting. You pay for your starting skills using character points. Starting character points are listed in the upper left of the setting. Both types of skill cost a number of character points equal to the level you want the skill to start at.

## Available Skills -- the idea that skills should be listed on the setting doc
Skills are all made up and characters should be able to do each of these things with their skills. probably more things too. Settings should include a list of stock/common skills. PC-made skills need tohave descriptive names. Other (stock/common) skills should have standardized names for DM sanity.

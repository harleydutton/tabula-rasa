A World is a template for worldbuilding. It includes a description of the world, the normal speed of characters in the world for combat, the amount of character points new characters in the world start with, a list of Mandatory Skills, and a list of Skills common within the World. The description includes the technological level, magic, history, spatial/geographic scope, flora, fauna, biomes, natural resources, items, culture, store, etc. of the World. To be mechanically playable a World needs an Action Delay, starting character points, a list of Mandatory Skills, a list of common skills, and a general description. Splitting the description into the cultural and the physical aspects of the world can be helpful. Creating a store is a good idea in most cases (unless you're a communist).

how much of the world does this World describe. If it's not the whole thing this document will need updated as the world grows or more of it is revealed) The storyteller can and probably should have a more comprehensive version of the World than they present the players.

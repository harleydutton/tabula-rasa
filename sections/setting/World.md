The, usually imaginary, place where the [[Character|Characters]] exist and the [[Story]] is told. Worlds are presented to players as a [[World Sheet]] with the usually-invisible backing of whatever [[Soft Worldbuilding]] the [[Storyteller]] has done.

A world is the culmination of whatever [[Worldbuilding]] you have done. blah blah blah I'm sleepy

A [[World Sheet]] is a template for worldbuilding. It includes ~~a description of the world,~~ the normal speed of characters in the world for timed actions like combat, the amount of [[Experience]] new characters in the world start with, and a list of [[Available Skills]] within the World. ~~The description includes the technological level, magic, history, spatial/geographic scope, flora, fauna, biomes, natural resources, items, culture, store, etc. of the World.~~

Scope (how much of the world does this setting describe. If it's not the whole thing this document will need updated as the world grows or more of it is revealed) The storyteller can and probably should have a more comprehensive version of the setting than they present the players.

----

settings are intended to grow and they are intended to be playable from almost nothing

If you start in a town with a description of the surrounding countryside, does the setting grow or do you need a new setting? what happens when you planeswalk?

should this be included in [[setting parts list]]?

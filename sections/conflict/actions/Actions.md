This is a list of specific example actions.
- [[Counterattack]]
- [[Advantages and Disadvantages]]
- [[Attacking]]
- [[Cause CC]]
- [[Defensive Actions]]
- [[Dropping held items]]
- [[Feint]]
- [[Footwork]]
- [[Held Actions]]
- [[Interactions]]
- [[Look around]]
- [[Movement]]
- [[Talking]]

---

the actions listed in here aren't amazingly [[Generic]]. They could be made more-so, or they could be removed. removing the notion of attacking, causing cc, etc. in favor of aggressive actions that have two attack modifiers: dmg, aoe, cc, etc.

I think all of these can be [[Supporting Action]] too.

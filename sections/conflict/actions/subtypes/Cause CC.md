This would be an action to cause another character to lose control of their character for a bit. This would probably take a [[Main Action]] and I will probably need to create some status effects--or one at the very least--in order to make this happen.

I think it makes more sense to have this be a [[Check Modifier]] rather than an [[Actions]]. If that's the case it might also make sense to have damage be a [[Check Modifier]] given that I'm already thinking extra damage it one [[size differential damage]]

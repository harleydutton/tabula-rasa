A zone is an area on the battlefield that is roughly one average movement distance across. Zones can be created manually as logical regions of the battlefield or procedurally by projecting an oversized (hex)grid onto the battlefield. A zone should have a name and a list of other zones it connects to. Zones can contain any number of characters.

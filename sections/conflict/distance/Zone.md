A zone is an area on the battlefield that is roughly one average movement distance across. Zones can be created manually as logical regions of the battlefield or procedurally by projecting an oversized (hex)grid onto the battlefield. A zone should have a name and a list of other zones it connects to. Zones can contain any number of characters.

A zone is an abstract unit of area. It is a maximum of one move action across such that characters can move between adjacent zones and do something meaningful in the same turn. A zone in an infinite field would be a circle however when terrain is introduced it expands and contracts sensibly. A zone's name should be a logical reflection of the area it represents on the map. Lastly, zones are much larger than most characters and can contain many characters.

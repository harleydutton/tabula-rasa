This system does not use distance for anything mechanical. It does not govern how far weapons can fire, how far characters can see, how large spells can be, nor even how far characters can move in one round. Most of these metrics have been eschewed in favor of DTMS checks. The last of these, "how far can a character move in a round?", is the exception and the answer is the purpose of this section.

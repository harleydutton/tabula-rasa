players can ask the storyteller if a combatant is "vulnerable/weak". What this means is "is the combatant at 1 health in a relevant health pool?" 

########## I might also consider adding another keyword storytellers can use to indicate that players can inflict dead on combatants at 1 HP in a relevant attribute.

if I make [[Statuses]] this might be one

with how I have changed damage, wounds, health, and death this no longer seems necessary but it should be evaluated further

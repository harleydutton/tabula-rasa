formerly "Action Delay"
is an [[Attribute]]; levels exponentially
The purpose of this stat is [[sections/conflict/timing/Action Delay]], a stat derived from it.

This is how fast a character is. Making it higer makes the character faster. Speed can be reduced by spending character points. See [combat](https://github.com/harleydutton/Tabula-Rasa/blob/develop/tabula-rasa.md#combat) for an explanation of how action delay works.


This is how long your character has to wait to do things in combat. Lower means faster. If you would like to decrease your action delay you can do so by spending CP. The typical default action delay is 10 but you should take a look at the setting document provided by your storyteller to make sure.

This is how long your character has to wait to do things in combat or some other timed conflict. A lower value means you can act more frequently in timed scenes which is why the speed stat is called “action delay.” If you would like to decrease your action delay you can do so by spending character points (CP) based on the chart below. The default action delay is 10 but you should take a look at the setting document provided by your storyteller to make sure. If you wish to be slower than normal, talk to your storyteller about it and they may grant you one or more boons depending upon how much slower than average you intend to be.

[[Problem]] this table is fucked. rotate it, change it from action delay to speed, remove the CP abbreviation, add the leveling formula. some of this might be unnecessary because [[Attribute Progression]] has this.

Contests are where two or more characters are trying to be best at some action. The problem comes in that there is a good chance both characters will succeed and so we must use magnitude of success to determine the winner of the contest. You only need one success to pass a skill check. Any successes beyond one contribute to magnitude of success. The character with the highest magnitude of success wins the contest. When the magnitudes of success are tied there is a tie.

Racing, feats of strength, public debates, drinking contents, and gambling are all common contests.

When conflict occurs during roleplaying, most of the time, the fairest way to resolve it is by rolling a check. Every character has base attributes (mind, body, spirit, and social) you can use, or you can use a skill if one is relevant. Tell the storyteller what you want to do and be specific. The storyteller will set a subjective difficulty (target number) for the action based on the chart in the [difficulty section](#_ogl1qn75g9xv) below. At this point you have three options. You can roll with that difficulty, abort the check, or [challenge](#_w7f8x3j78p3y) the difficulty the storyteller set. If you decide to proceed, roll a number of six-sided dice equal to the skill or attribute's level. If any meet or exceed the target number (based on that subjective difficulty the storyteller set earlier) you pass the check and what you described happens.

If Sam wants to jump over a river and has an athletics skill of 5, Sam would say "I want to jump across the river." The storyteller might tell him "that will be hard because the rain made the ground muddy and your footing is bad," which means the target number is 6 instead of 5 on a six-sided die. When Sam rolls, if any one of Sam's 5 dice come up as a 6, Sam successfully jumps across the river. On the other hand, if Sam does not get any sixes, he fails to jump across, likely resulting in him landing in the river.

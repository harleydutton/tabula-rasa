The difficulty of a skill check can be modified by a number of things. A character's flavor, other characters, and the world itself can all cause a skill-check to become easier or harder. The storyteller decides if any of these things is meaningful enough to make the roll easy or hard.
```
easy    |   pass if skill >= 1d6
normal  |   pass if skill >= 2d6
hard    |   pass if skill >= 3d6
harder  |   pass if skill >= 4d6
etc.    |   pass if skill >= 5d6
```

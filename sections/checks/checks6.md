## Checks

When conflict occurs during roleplaying, most of the time, the fairest way to resolve it is by rolling a check. Every character has base attributes (mind, body, spirit, and social) you can use, or you can use a skill if one is relevant. Tell the storyteller what you want to do and be specific. The storyteller will set a subjective difficulty (target number) for the action based on the chart in the [difficulty section](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1IdpkyR5XzUpkYwrZ0e7dhVONLq8gUa03OIkV1lhy-ME/edit#heading=h.ogl1qn75g9xv) below. At this point you have three options. You can roll with that difficulty, abort the check, or [challenge](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1IdpkyR5XzUpkYwrZ0e7dhVONLq8gUa03OIkV1lhy-ME/edit#heading=h.w7f8x3j78p3y) the difficulty the storyteller set. If you decide to proceed, roll a number of six-sided dice equal to the skill or attribute's level. If any meet or exceed the target number (based on that subjective difficulty the storyteller set earlier) you pass the check and what you described happens.

If Sam wants to jump over a river and has an athletics skill of 5, Sam would say "I want to jump across the river." The storyteller might tell him "that will be hard because the rain made the ground muddy and your footing is bad," which means the target number is 6 instead of 5 on a six-sided die. When Sam rolls, if any one of Sam's 5 dice come up as a 6, Sam successfully jumps across the river. On the other hand, if Sam does not get any sixes, he fails to jump across, likely resulting in him landing in the river.

### Difficulty

The storyteller can assign five different difficulties to actions for checks: Trivial, Easy, Normal, Hard, and Impossible. The difficulty of a skill check can be modified by flavor, context, or the innate ease or difficulty of the action itself. The storyteller decides if any of these things is meaningful enough to change the difficulty though players can [challenge](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1IdpkyR5XzUpkYwrZ0e7dhVONLq8gUa03OIkV1lhy-ME/edit#heading=h.w7f8x3j78p3y) this ruling if they wish. The subjective difficulty of a roll translates directly to a target number, meaning when you roll a check only dice that are greater than or equal to the target number count as successes.


|difficulty|target number|
|-|-|
|trivial|auto pass|
|easy|4|
|moderate|5|
|hard|6|
|impossible|auto fail|

### Composite Actions

If a character wants to do two or more things that are both possible but not trivial at the same time, you might be wondering what to do. Which skill do you use? What affect does this have on the difficulty?

1.  If both actions would be using the same skill or attribute, simply make the check using that and modify the difficulty to fit.
2.  If the composite action resembles one action more than the other, use that skill and modify the difficulty to fit.
3.  If one of the actions is dependent on the other, roll multiple checks sequentially and modify the difficulty of the later checks based on the results of the earlier checks.

### Magnitude of Success

Sometimes there are conflicts where multiple characters are competing for the same goal. In horse races, arm wrestling, poker games, and drinking contests multiple characters will be attempting to win but only one can. In all likelihood, multiple characters will pass a check to win any given contest. How do we deal with this situation? The answer is to calculate how much each character succeeded and compare those values.

Normally we only care if a check passes or fails, but in these instances we want to know by how much. When a check is rolled magnitude of success starts at 0 and increases by 1 for each six-sided die that equals or exceeds the target number ([difficulty](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1IdpkyR5XzUpkYwrZ0e7dhVONLq8gUa03OIkV1lhy-ME/edit#heading=h.ogl1qn75g9xv)).

To resolve a contest of some kind each character involved should make a check, and their magnitudes of success should be ranked, highest to lowest. The highest result wins the contest. Ties can occur.

### DTMS Checks

There is one special kind of check that the storyteller will make frequently. These are DTMS checks which stands for "Does this make sense?" They don't use dice and they aren't a check in the traditional sense. DTMS checks are just a way for me to shorthand the idea "use your brain to decide if this should be allowed or not."

### Challenging

When a player disagrees with the difficulty of a check they can challenge the difficulty the storyteller has set. When a player challenges the difficulty of a check, this means they are asking the table to vote for what they think the difficulty should be. The storyteller's vote breaks ties. The purpose of this system is to deal with storytellers who are a little unfair some of the time, not make all checks "easy". Each check can only have its difficulty challenged once.

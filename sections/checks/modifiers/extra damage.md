## size differential damage
### problem: size -> force
a towering behemoth should be able to oneshot a lightly armored character with a tree he ripped out of the ground, right? well, how do you represent that in this system? We should probably assume most critters are about the same size OR we can forget the numbers in combat and just use common sense.

I think a solution to this could be to add an [[Check Modifier]] that gives the potential to add an additional [[Wound]] flavor.

This is the modifier promised by [[size differential damage]]. the attacker deals an additional flavor of damage.

Perhaps all damage should be from modifiers.

Rather than modifiers, whenever you roll a check you can specify two effects. For attacks, usually one or both of these would be damage.

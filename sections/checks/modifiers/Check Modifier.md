Checks are made such that one success is a partial success and two is a full success. The idea here is that players choose one or more modifiers, each making the check harder, and if they get a full success, they happen. Otherwise, the attack happens but the modifiers do not. Whenever you are taking a modified action you are also using your [[Supporting Action]].

	- probably need a more generic attack modifiers list. also something that will work in mental or [[Presence]] combat. I.e. Making an attack hard to evade is difficulty hard. Other mods include multitarget, lethal, feint, etc.

I think I'm scrapping this system in favor of the [[Supporting Action]] system. rejecting as soon as I iron this all out.

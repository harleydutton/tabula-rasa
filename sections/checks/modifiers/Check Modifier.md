Checks are made such that one success is a partial success and two is a full success. The idea here is that players choose one or more modifiers, each making the check harder, and if they get a full success, they happen. Otherwise, the attack happens but the modifiers do not.

	- probably need a more generic attack modifiers list. also something that will work in mental or [[Presence]] combat. I.e. Making an attack hard to evade is difficulty hard. Other mods include multitarget, lethal, feint, etc.

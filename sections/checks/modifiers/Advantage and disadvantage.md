### advantages and disadvantages
this looks like it came from the star wars RP system?
anyway it looks interesting. I cannot tell if it is for combat or all checks or what.
> As a part of any action a character may attempt to create an advantage for themselves. If the action succeeds whomever is controlling the character gets to describe the advantage they create. If the storyteller finds it reasonable it happens. If not, don’t waste time arguing, just move on.
> An advantage can also take the form of having to roll fewer dice on a skill check in the future, extra damage dice on an attack roll, or a bonus to initiative. Inversely an advantage might mean that the character’s opponents have to roll more dice on skill checks, get fewer dice on their damage rolls, or lose initiative.

This sounds like it could make for an interesting [[Check Modifier]]

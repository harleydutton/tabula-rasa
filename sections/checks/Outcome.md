formerly "partial and perfect successes"
I think I want MOS to be # of successes on the roll and to generally not matter above 2. I want 1 to be a partial success and 2 to be a perfect success.

other outcomes are [[Crit success and fail]]

|successes|outcome|
|-|-|
|0|failure|
|1|partial success|
|2+|success|

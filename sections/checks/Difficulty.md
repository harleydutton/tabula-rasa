The storyteller can assign a check five different difficulties: Trivial, Easy, Normal, Hard, and Impossible. The difficulty of a skill check can be modified by flavor, context, or the innate ease or difficulty of the action itself. The storyteller decides if any of these things is meaningful enough to change the difficulty. The subjective difficulty of a roll translates directly to a target number, meaning when you roll a check only dice that are greater than or equal to the target number count as successes. The players can challenge the difficulty the storyteller has prescribed if they wish.

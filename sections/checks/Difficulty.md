The storyteller can assign a check five different difficulties: Trivial, Easy, Normal, Hard, and Impossible. The difficulty of a skill check can be modified by flavor, context, or the innate ease or difficulty of the action itself. The storyteller decides if any of these things is meaningful enough to change the difficulty. The subjective difficulty of a roll translates directly to a target number, meaning when you roll a check only dice that are greater than or equal to the target number count as successes. The players can challenge the difficulty the storyteller has prescribed if they wish. If this happens everyone votes on the desired difficulty and the storyteller wins ties.

|   |   |   |   |   |   |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
|**Difficulty**|**Trivial**|**Easy**|**Normal**|**Hard**|**Impossible**|
|Target Number|Automatic Pass|4|5|6|Automatic Fail|

The difficulty of a skill check can be modified by a number of things. A character's flavor, other characters, and the world itself can all cause a skill-check to become easier or harder. The storyteller decides if any of these things is meaningful enough to make the roll easy or hard.
```
easy    |   pass if skill >= 1d6
normal  |   pass if skill >= 2d6
hard    |   pass if skill >= 3d6
harder  |   pass if skill >= 4d6
etc.    |   pass if skill >= 5d6
```

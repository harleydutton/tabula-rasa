When a player disagrees with the difficulty of a check they can challenge the difficulty the storyteller has set. Effectively this is asking the table to vote for what they think the difficulty should be. The storyteller's vote counts as 1.5. The purpose of this system is to deal with storytellers who are a little unfair some of the time, not make all checks Easy.

an opposed check is where one character makes a check to do something to another character, and if the other character would like to oppose this action, they make a relevant check, typically using an attribute, and their [[Magnitude of success]] subtracts from the original check's magnitude of success. In this instance, both magnitude of successes can go above 2 until after the subtraction.

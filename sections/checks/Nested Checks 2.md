When you want to perform an action involving multiple different skills you might have to make a nested skill check. What this means is that you roll a check for each skill involved and if any of them fail the action fails. If they all succeed the action succeeds.

To back flip down some stairs while shooting a fireball up the stairs you would need to pass both acrobatics and fire magic checks.

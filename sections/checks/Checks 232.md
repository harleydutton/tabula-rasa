When conflict occurs during roleplaying, most of the time, the fairest way to resolve it is by rolling a skill check, or check for short. You can always use one of the attributes (`mind`, `body`, `spirit`, and `social`) or you can use a relevant skill your character has. Tell the storyteller what you want to do with your skill and be specific. The storyteller will set a subjective difficulty (target number) for the action. At this point you have three options. You can roll with that difficulty, abort the check, or [challenge](#challenging) the difficulty the storyteller set. If you decide to proceed, roll a number of dice equal the skill's level. If any meet or exceed the target number you pass the check and what you described happens.

> If Sam wants to jump over a river and has an `athletics` skill of 5, Sam would say "I want to jump across the river." The storyteller might tell him "that will be hard because the rain made the ground muddy and your footing is bad," which means the target number is 6 instead of 5 on a six-sided die. When Sam rolls, if any one of Sam's 5 dice come up as a 6, Sam successfully jumps across the river. On the other hand, if Sam does not get any sixes, he fails to jump across, likely resulting in him landing in the river.

When conflict occurs during roleplaying, most of the time, the fairest way to resolve it is by rolling a skill check, or check for short. You can always use one of the mandatory skills (mind, body, spirit, and social) or you can use another relevant skill your character has. Tell the storyteller what you want to do with your skill and feel free to be specific--Actually specific is better. The storyteller will set a subjective difficulty (target number) for the action. At this point you have options. You can roll, abort, or challenge the difficulty the storyteller set. Roll a number of dice equal the skill's level. If any beat the target number you pass the check and what you described happens.

If Sam wants to stab a goblin and sam has a fencing skill of 5, Sam would say "I want to skewer the goblin through the heart with my rapier!". The storyteller tells him "that will be hard" which means the target number is 6. If any one of Sam's 5 dice come up as a 6, Sam kills the goblin.

### **Difficulty**

The storyteller can assign a check five different difficulties: Trivial, Easy, Normal, Hard, and Impossible. The difficulty of a skill check can be modified by flavor, context, or the innate ease or difficulty of the action itself. The storyteller decides if any of these things is meaningful enough to change the difficulty. The subjective difficulty of a roll translates directly to a target number, meaning when you roll a check only dice that are greater than or equal to the target number count as successes. The players can challenge the difficulty the storyteller has prescribed if they wish. If this happens everyone votes on the desired difficulty and the storyteller wins ties.

|   |   |   |   |   |   |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
     
|**Difficulty**|**Trivial**|**Easy**|**Normal**|**Hard**|**Impossible**|
|Target Number|Automatic Pass|4|5|6|Automatic Fail|

### **Nested Checks**

When you want to perform an action involving multiple different skills you might have to make a nested skill check. What this means is that you roll a check for each skill involved and if any of them fail the action fails. If they all succeed the action succeeds.

To back flip down some stairs while shooting a fireball up the stairs you would need to pass both acrobatics and fire magic checks.

### **Contests**

Contests are where two or more characters are trying to be best at some action. The problem comes in that there is a good chance both characters will succeed and so we must use magnitude of success to determine the winner of the contest. You only need one success to pass a skill check. Any successes beyond one contribute to magnitude of success. The character with the highest magnitude of success wins the contest.

Racing, feats of strength, public debates, drinking contents, and gambling are all common contests.

### **DTMS Checks**

There is one special kind of check that the storyteller will make frequently. These are DTMS checks which stands for "Does this make sense?" They don't use dice and they aren't a check in the traditional sense. DTMS checks are just a way for me to shorthand the idea "use your brain to decide if this should be allowed or not."

### **Challenging**

When a player disagrees with the difficulty of a check they can challenge the difficulty the storyteller has set. Effectively this is asking the table to vote for what they think the difficulty should be. The storyteller's vote counts as 1.5. The purpose of this system is to deal with storytellers who are a little unfair some of the time, not make all checks Easy.

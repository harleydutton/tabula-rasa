When conflict occurs during roleplaying the fairest way to resolve it most times is by rolling a skill-check. A skill-check is where one of a character's skills is tested against some number of dice which represent the difficulty of the task. If the character's skill is greater than or equal to the sum of the dice then the character passes the skill-check. Usually this will also mean that whatever the character was attmepting to accomplish succeeds. If the dice are greater than the character's skill level the action fails and something bad might happen. The number of dice depends on the difficulty of the task. Flavor can influence difficulty.

When conflict occurs during roleplaying, most of the time, the fairest way to resolve it is by rolling a skill check, or check for short. You can always use one of the mandatory skills (mind, body, spirit, and social) or you can use another relevant skill your character has. Tell the storyteller what you want to do with your skill and feel free to be specific--Actually specific is better. The storyteller will set a subjective difficulty (target number) for the action. At this point you have options. You can roll, abort, or challenge the difficulty the storyteller set. Roll a number of dice equal the skill's level. If any meet or exceed the target number you pass the check and what you described happens.

If Sam wants to jump over a river and has an `athletics` skill of 5, Sam would say "I want to jump across the river." The storyteller might tell him "that will be hard because the rain made the ground muddy and your footing is bad," which means the target number is 6 instead of 5 on a six-sided die. When Sam rolls, if any one of Sam's 5 dice come up as a 6, Sam successfully jumps across the river. On the other hand, if Sam does not get any sixes, he fails to jump across, likely resulting in him landing in the river.

If Sam wants to stab a goblin and sam has a fencing skill of 5, Sam would say "I want to skewer the goblin through the heart with my rapier!". The storyteller tells him "that will be hard" which means the target number is 6. If any one of Sam's 5 dice come up as a 6, Sam kills the goblin.

there was an image here. probably an example. maybe this? this image sucks

When conflict occurs during roleplaying, most of the time, the fairest way to resolve it is by rolling a check. Every character has base attributes (mind, body, spirit, and social) you can use, or you can use a skill if one is relevant. Tell the storyteller what you want to do and be specific. The storyteller will set a subjective difficulty (target number) for the action based on the chart in the [difficulty section](#_ogl1qn75g9xv) below. At this point you have three options. You can roll with that difficulty, abort the check, or [challenge](#_w7f8x3j78p3y) the difficulty the storyteller set. If you decide to proceed, roll a number of six-sided dice equal to the skill or attribute's level. If any meet or exceed the target number (based on that subjective difficulty the storyteller set earlier) you pass the check and what you described happens.

If Sam wants to jump over a river and has an athletics skill of 5, Sam would say "I want to jump across the river." The storyteller might tell him "that will be hard because the rain made the ground muddy and your footing is bad," which means the target number is 6 instead of 5 on a six-sided die. When Sam rolls, if any one of Sam's 5 dice come up as a 6, Sam successfully jumps across the river.

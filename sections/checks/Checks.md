When a [[Character]] takes an action that could succeed or fail, the [[Storyteller]] will call for a check.

1. Describe the action you want your character to attempt.
2. The storyteller sets a [[Difficulty]].
3. Choose an appropriate [[Skill]]. If you don't have one, use [[Mind]], [[Body]], [[Spirit]], or [[Presence]].
4. Roll a number of dice equal to your [[Skill]] level. Roll [[The Event Die]] if directed to.
5. Everyone is given an opportunity to [[Oppose]] the check.
6. The storyteller describes the [[Outcome]].

>If Sam wants to jump over a river and has an `athletics skill of 5`, Sam would say "I want to jump across the river." The storyteller tells him "`that will be hard` because the rain made the ground muddy and your footing is bad." When Sam rolls, he gets `2,2,3,5,6, which is a partial success`. The storyteller says "you get across the river okay but you splash your pants with mud as you land."

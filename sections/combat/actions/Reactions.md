Reactions are actions that characters can use to act out of turn. This is most commonly used for defensive actions. Anytime a character uses their reaction they can make a free defensive action. Acting out of turn to counterattack, defend yourself or another character, or by holding a major action all require a character's reaction. On the subject of ordering, all actions must be able to be reacted to. In addition all reactions occur after the action that caused them.

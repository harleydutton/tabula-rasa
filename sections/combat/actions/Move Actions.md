Move actions are the simplest of the actions. If you need to change [zones](#zones) in battle you will need to make a move action. That said small bits of movement in the same zone like footwork in combat or walking two meters to a different computer terminal would not be considered large enough movement to require a move action. See the [Distance](#distance) section for a more complete look at the movement system. Sometimes when using a reaction to dodge the dodge won't make sense unless it also moves you. In this case you will also need a move action in order to dodge.

To get started with a timed scene each character will need to have a first turn. Each player rolls 1d6 for their character and the storyteller rolls 1d6 for each NPC. This is the turn each character starts on. If a character is joining the scene late, their first turn is 1d6 after the current tick. See the surprise section for special cases.

Tim is starting a pie eating contest with two of his friends. When he rolls 3 on 1d6 his first turn is on tick 3.

Lets say the tick is 32 and one of the spectators, Joey, has decided he wants to participate. Joey rolls a 5 on 1d6 which means that Joey's first turn will be on tick 37.

## **Distance**

This system does not use distance for anything mechanical. It does not govern how far weapons can fire, how far characters can see, how large spells can be, nor even how far characters can move in one round. Most of these metrics have been eschewed in favor of DTMS checks. The last of these, "how far can a character move in a round?", is the exception and the answer is the purpose of this section.

### **Zones**

A zone is an abstract unit of area. It is a maximum of one move action across such that characters can move between adjacent zones and do something meaningful in the same turn. A zone in an infinite field would be a circle however when terrain is introduced it expands and contracts sensibly. A zone's name should be a logical reflection of the area it represents on the map. Lastly, zones are much larger than most characters and can contain many characters.

Living room, dining room, master bedroom, guest bedroom, basement, front yard, back yard, street, garage, bathroom, kitchen

### **Battlefields**

At the appropriate scale, battlefields are very useful for visualizing terrain. All battlefields are a collection of zones which are typically presented as a drawing or collection of figurines and set pieces. Battlefields are an excellent tool for keeping track of spacial information in a story.

Below is a battlefield of a castle consisting of tower and wall segments 1-5 and 1-6 respectively, a keep, a gate, and a courtyard divided into sections based on the cardinal directions.

### **Movement**

Characters have a tendency to move around battlefields. Typically characters need to pass DTMS checks to move between zones. Whenever a character is in combat and have a movement action to spend they can move between two logically connected adjacent zones on the battlefield. Atypically characters can move between unconnected zones or zones missing a logical connection by by passing a skill check for a relevant skills. Outside of combat characters can usually move around the battlefield with a large degree of freedom.

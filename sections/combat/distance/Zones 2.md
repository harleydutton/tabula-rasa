A zone is an abstract unit of area. It is a maximum of one move action across such that characters can move between adjacent zones and do something meaningful in the same turn. A zone in an infinite field would be a circle however when terrain is introduced it expands and contracts sensibly. A zone's name should be a logical reflection of the area it represents on the map. Lastly, zones are much larger than most characters and can contain many characters.

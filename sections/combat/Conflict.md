This really isn't a section describing combat, but instead a section describing any extended competitive activity within a story where timing is incredibly important. Sword and gun fights certainly fit the mould, sure, but so do a number of other things like horse races, ritual summoning gone wrong, and trying to command a fleet with light-minutes of delay. Combat in this game is based on actions and cooldowns. Despite this these rules will focus on the more traditional combat and I will leave you, dear reader, to adapt them to your competitive pie-eating contests as necessary.

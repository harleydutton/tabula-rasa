## Fatigue
If a character needs rest but goes without it they gain a point of fatigue. Points of fatigue are cumulative. As fatigue increases the character experiences more bad stuff, but what exactly is a problem I haven't sorted out yet. Other sources of fatigue may include casting powerful spells or performing strenuous activity while wounded.

I see fatigue as being a binary. you're tired or you're well rested. Go to sleep. Things are hard until you do.

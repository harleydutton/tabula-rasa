This section will detail a system for long distance travel:
potential new terms: [[Rest]], fatigue, [[load]]
Desired outcome of this section is distance traveled per time
It will be necessary for the storyteller to set a typical travel speed.
It will be necessary for the storyteller to choose between grid or not.
Travel should also be kinda like downtime.
increase or decrease rest/fatigue?



Other things cause fatigue.

Rest is also how you heal wounds.

we can just call the world map that, the world, or the map.

this section should detail how you get from point a to point b in the world, what it costs, what you get, what happens along the way, and how fast this all happens.

so, traveling from point a to point b should take some number of days
one day per tile on the world map usually. 
what if a and b are adjacent? then you use hours as your timescale
what if they arent? you use days as your timescale

there should maybe be a chance for things to happen while traveling?
time taken (fatigue gained/lost, resources gained/used, healing), distance traveled
time vs distance traveled
fatigue makes the ratio worse
sneaking makes the ratio worse
being hurt makes the ratio worse
carrying too much makes the ratio worse

you get fatigued from:
- something to do with rest i.e. not resting or having your rest interrupted.
- something to do with wounds i.e. getting wounds/doing stuff while wounded/having wounds


Time Scales:
travel using downtime = measured in days and hours
rest = measured in hours
active = measured in minutes
combat = measured in second

A [[Character|Character's]] wealth [[Attribute]] represents the total number of [[Prices|Cheap]] [[Items]] and [[Money]] they *should* possess. At the end of [[Downtime]], count the character's moderately priced items and add this to their money, then add or remove currency or items until that total matches their wealth attribute. Either the [[Player]] or the [[Storyteller]] can justify this.

Items are [[Descriptors]] that represent the things a [[Character]] *has*, usually physical possessions though for the purposes of [[Wealth]] ongoing expenses or hired help might also count as items. All items are fundamentally the same in that they are items, although some will have different [[Prices]] in the [[Store]].

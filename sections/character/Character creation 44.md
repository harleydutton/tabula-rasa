To make a character first read through the setting document your storyteller has provided you with. If they have not done so, bug them about it. You cannot go forward without it.

When you have done this and understand the world you will be playing in, read this section and fill in the character sheet at the end with what you have learned. Ask your storyteller for help with things you do not understand or consult the table of contents.

### **Identifying Information**

These things go on your sheet to keep you and your storyteller sane in real life. You can omit these things if you like but it is not recommended and I already carved out some space on the sheet for it.

- Name: The character's name
- Concept: The characters _desired or intended_ role in the story
- Player: The player's name
- Setting: The setting for the story
- Story: The name of the story the character was in if available

### **Remaining Character Points**

The storyteller should be tracking the character points they have distributed to the group on the setting document. Each player should be keeping track of how many of these have _not_ spent on their character sheet such that they can easily take new skills.

### **Motivations**

Tell me why your character gets out of bed in the morning. What is their purpose? Do they seek revenge? To protect something? Are they on the run? Do they want to be respected? Are they searching for something? Do they have any ideals that they follow? These are all motivations that will give a storyteller a good way to interact with your character. You must have at least one but you should consider having a few so your character isn’t one-dimensional and boring. Be careful of taking too many as well as your character could end up as a conflicted mess.

### **Aesthetic Description**

This is a good place to describe your character's look. This could include things like gender, age, weight, build, height, bearing, clothes, species (if applicable), stereotypical class, etc. The purpose of this section is to give the other players and the storyteller a mental image of your character. If you want anything here to influence your rolls it should also be added to flavor.

### **Flavor**

Flavor is a word or short (two-word) phrase describing your character and it is how you give your character personality and make them unique. While you could say your character has clothes and the ability to speak, let's not worry about that and instead focus on the things that spice your character up! You aren’t just a rebel with a cause, you’re a smokin’ hot rebel with a cause.

Flavor can include knowledge, possessions, physique, and even social position. Flavor costs one [character point](#_o3tr0ykifwm1) (CP) at character creation and can be obtained later in the game at storyteller discretion. The storyteller can inflict flavor upon characters during the story. When resolving a conflict using a check, flavor can sometimes modify the roll making it more or less likely that you succeed. This should not be a piece of flavor’s only purpose.

### **Hooks**

Hooks are a special piece of flavor that the storyteller can use to interact specifically with your character to create tension within the story. Adding a hook to your character is the typical way to go about getting a boon and it also integrates your character into the story a little better most times. A hook can be a love interest, an enemy, a debt, a cause, a disability, and much more. When you would like to add a hook to your character you must first discuss it with your storyteller and if they agree to let you take the hook you also get a boon. Hooks are distinct from motivations in that they don't always come from within e.g. being #17 on the FBI most wanted list.

### **Boons**

Boons are the exception to the rules when it comes to flavor and skills. Specifically a boon lets you have a skill or flavor marked as “boon” in the [what is not allowed](#_5nz680a5nyup) section of the setting document. If something there is marked as “boon” your character needs a boon to be or have it. In a world that has none perhaps your character has uncovered the secret to magic or firearms or telecommunication. Boons can only be obtained through hooks and they are usually related. Boons can also be exchanged for a renewable major purchase.

### **Skills**

Skills are the most mechanical part of a character. They represent the things your character can do within the game and allow your character to take actions by rolling checks. Skills have levels and are usually self-descriptively named though there is space for skill descriptions on the character sheet. You can purchase skills with character points (CP) at character creation and level them up later using CP. Your setting document will have a list of a few example skills you can take that are appropriate for the setting.

|   |   |   |   |   |   |   |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
|**Level**|**1**|**2**|**3**|**4**|**5**|**X+1**|
|CP Cost|1 CP|2 CP|3 CP|4 CP|5 CP|X CP|
|Total CP|1 CP|3 CP|6 CP|10 CP|15 CP|X(X+1)/2 CP|

pickpocket, pyromancy, intimidation, stealth, clairvoyance, and blocking are all examples of skills.

### **Adding to the Setting**

It is the intent of this system that you can play what you want. Players can speak with the storyteller and propose things to be added to the setting. If you want to play a cat-man samurai, talk to the storyteller about adding cat-men to the setting and if samurai need special skills or flavor–probably equipment in this instance–to be relevant, propose those too. If the storyteller has no objections, boom, you can play exactly what you want.

#### **Veto**

Many sections in this document talk about “storyteller discretion.” The storyteller can reject your additions to the setting for any reason–though it is best if they give one. You can complain, but ultimately the storyteller is the one telling the story and doesn't have to put your idea in the story no matter how much you want it there.

#### **Theme**

A common reason for an addition to a setting to be rejected is because of its theme. Most commonly, goofy additions will be rejected when a storyteller wants to tell a “serious” story. Sometimes naming your character Reggie Fuckhammer or being a vampire that shapeshifts into a seagull or platypus will clash a little too much with the setting. Sure there are storytellers who will jump at that but try to stay within the themes outlined in the setting document.

#### **Scope**

Many times, players will try to create skills that are much too broad in scope. Less frequently, players will make skills that are too narrow in scope. Loosely speaking scope represents the percentage of situations a skill can apply to. An example of a skill that is too broad is magic as you can do anything you want with it. A skill that is too narrow would be death curse as it can only be used to kill someone. Somewhere in between we find the skill death magic which has many applications but not infinitely many. It has a specific domain in which it is useful. Storytellers should specifically look out for skills that are too broad during character creation and veto them.

#### **Limiting Factors**

If you create a skill with appropriate scope that is just too powerful for the setting or story (most magic skills) your storyteller may inflict a few limiting factors upon the skill you have proposed for your character.

@Storyteller: A few good limiting factors are timing restrictions (requires multiple turns in combat, cannot be done in combat, takes multiple days, etc.), resource costs (add a mana bar, minor purchases, major purchases, etc.), context restrictions (must have line of sight, must have eye contact, must be touching the target, must have a piece of the target, etc.), and cooldowns (AUTs or turns, once per combat, once per day, refreshes randomly, etc.). If you cannot balance a skill, veto it.

#### **Uniqueness**

When you add something to the setting you may have it in your head that it will be unique. You will be the only fire mage, you will have the only gun, you will be the only alien, etc. This can very quickly lead to an unbalanced and unenjoyable setting or story. Do not expect to have a monopoly on anything you add to the setting. Where there is one, there can be two.

### **Attributes**

Attributes Body, Mind, Spirit and Social. They are very similar to skills but have meaningful differences. First, every character gets the first level of each attribute for free. Second, attributes cost significantly more CP to level up than skills do. Third, attributes are broad and if a character does not have an applicable skill they can roll an attribute. For this reason attributes are frequently used as defensive skills and for perception checks. Lastly, attributes represent a character's physical, mental, spiritual, and social health. This is discussed in more depth in the Damage section.

|   |   |   |   |   |   |   |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
|**Level**|**1**|**2**|**3**|**4**|**5**|**X**|
|CP Cost|free|4 CP|9 CP|16 CP|25 CP|X^2 CP|
|Total CP|free|4 CP|13 CP|29 CP|54 CP|(X(X+1)(2X+1)/6)-1 CP|
 

### **Speed**

This is how long your character has to wait to do things in combat or some other timed conflict. A lower value means you can act more frequently in timed scenes which is why the speed stat is called “action delay.” If you would like to decrease your action delay you can do so by spending character points (CP) based on the chart below. The default action delay is 10 but you should take a look at the setting document provided by your storyteller to make sure. If you wish to be slower than normal, talk to your storyteller about it and they may grant you one or more boons depending upon how much slower than average you intend to be.

|   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
||**Default**|**-1 AD**|**-2 AD**|**-3 AD**|**-4 AD**|**-5 AD**|**-X AD**|
|Cost for -1 AD|free|1 CP|4 CP|9 CP|16 CP|25 CP|X^2 CP|
|Total cost|free|1 CP|5 CP|14 CP|30 CP|55 CP|...|

### **NPCs**

If you go through the character creation process for a non-player character (NPC), you should end up with a character of similar power level to the player characters (PCs), assuming you use the same amount of character points (CP). If they need to be combat capable make sure they have an action delay (AD) as outlined in the speed section. If you NPC is there for story purposes make sure they have _at least_ one motivation. Leaving a large chunk of your NPCs CP unspent keeps them flexible so they can grow to meet the needs of your story.

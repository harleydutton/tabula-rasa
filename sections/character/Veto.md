The storyteller can reject your additions to the setting for any reason. You can bitch and moan but ultimately the storyteller is the one telling the story and doesn't have to put your idea in the story no matter how much you want it there. Come up with a new idea.

@Storyteller: In the interest of reducing arguing, bitching, and moaning, give a reason for your veto.

Many sections in this document talk about “storyteller discretion.” The storyteller can reject your additions to the setting for any reason–though it is best if they give one. You can complain, but ultimately the storyteller is the one telling the story and doesn't have to put your idea in the story no matter how much you want it there.

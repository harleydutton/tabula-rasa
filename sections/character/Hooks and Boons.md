Character hooks, or hooks for short, are a way to get boons and give the storyteller a way to pull you further into the story. A hook is anything that allows the storyteller to motivate your character specifically. A hook can be a love interest, an enemy, a debt, a cause, a disability, and much more.

Boons, on the other hand, are rewards that are unobtainable except through hooks and roleplaying. Both hooks and boons can be anything but usually end up being flavor. The storyteller must agree to grant you the boon you want or either of the boon and major purchase flavors for the hook you are offering; be reasonable. The flavors boon and major purchase are equal in value and can be converted. Speak with your storyteller to trade these flavors for boons or things from the major purchase column of the setting's store.

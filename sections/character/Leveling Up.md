Over the course of the [[Story]], as the [[Storyteller]] distributes [[Experience]], [[Player|Players]] will have the option to make their [[Character|Characters]] stronger by spending that experience. Existing [[Skill|Skills]] and [[Attribute|Attributes]] can both be leveled up but they have different price per level. Skills use [[Linear Scaling]] and attributes use [[Quadratic Scaling]]. For anything else, notably [[Background|Backgrounds]], [[Items]], and new skills, go to [[New Content Negotiation]].

## Identification Information

This info is of little relevance to a character and of great relevance to the actual human people playing them. This stuff is useful to put on your sheet to keep things from getting lost or disorganized but you are welcome to skip it.

-   Name: The character's name
-   Concept: The characters role in the story
-   Player: The player's name
-   Setting: The name of the character's setting
-   Story: The name of the story the character was in



These things go on your sheet to keep you and your storyteller sane in real life. You can omit these things if you like but it is not recommended and I already carved out some space on the sheet for it.

- Name: The character's name
- Player: The player's name

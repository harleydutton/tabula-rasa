new variety of [[Descriptors]]

rename "Traits"?

backgrounds can be large collections of [[Descriptors]] and even modify mechanics as long as they are defined in the setting.

all backgrounds should be listed on the setting doc. will need a backgound creation section in the setting section

A background is something you are or something you know.

	- wizard, vampire, robot, orc, guardsman, and the like
	- common, elvish, the name of the wind

I should make a species/classes definition so settings can easily list them.

"collections of flavor" is apt but sounds stupid. IDK what the name should be but the concept is that games will frequently have collections of flavor like "vampire" which means "drinks blood", "dies to sunlight", "pretty", "supernatural healing", and "undead". I need a system for this.

To make a character first read through the setting document your storyteller has provided you with. When you have done this and understand the world you will be playing in read through this and fill in the sections for the character sheet--located at the end of this section--using what you have learned. Ask your storyteller for help with things you do not understand or consult the table of contents.

To make a character first read through the setting document your storyteller has provided you with. If they have not done so, bug them about it. You cannot go forward without it.

When you have done this and understand the world you will be playing in, read this section and fill in the character sheet at the end with what you have learned. Ask your storyteller for help with things you do not understand or consult the table of contents.
### **Identification Information**

These things go on your sheet to keep you and your storyteller sane in real life. You can omit these things if you like but it is not recommended and I already carved out some space on the sheet for it.

- Name: The character's name
- Player: The player's name
- Setting: The name of the character's setting
- Story: The name of the story the character was in
- Concept:
- character points: group + individual - spent = current

### Speed

This is how long your character has to wait to do things in combat. Lower means faster. If you would like to decrease your action delay you can do so by spending CP. The typical default action delay is 10 but you should take a look at the setting document provided by your storyteller to make sure.

This is how long your character has to wait to do things in combat or some other timed conflict. A lower value means you can act more frequently in timed scenes which is why the speed stat is called “action delay.” If you would like to decrease your action delay you can do so by spending character points (CP) based on the chart below. The default action delay is 10 but you should take a look at the setting document provided by your storyteller to make sure. If you wish to be slower than normal, talk to your storyteller about it and they may grant you one or more boons depending upon how much slower than average you intend to be.

|   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
||**Default**|**-1 AD**|**-2 AD**|**-3 AD**|**-4 AD**|**-5 AD**|**-X AD**|
|Cost for -1 AD|0|1 CP|4 CP|9 CP|16 CP|25 CP|X^2 CP|
|Total cost|0|1 CP|5 CP|14 CP|30 CP|55 CP|...|
[[problems]] this table is fucked. rotate it, change it from action delay to speed, remove the CP abbreviation, add the leveling formula. some of this might be unnecessary because [[Attribute Progression]] has this.


### **Remaining Character Points**

The storyteller should be tracking the [[Character Points]] they have distributed to the group on the setting document. Each player should be keeping track of how much of this they have not spent on their character sheet such that they can easily take new skills.

### **Motivations**

Tell me why your character gets out of bed in the morning. What is their purpose? Do they seek revenge? To protect something? Are they on the run? Do they want to be respected? Are they searching for something? Do they have any ideals that they follow? These are all motivations that will give a storyteller a good way to interact with your character. You must have at least one and you should consider taking a few.

Tell me why your character gets out of bed in the morning. What is their purpose? Do they seek revenge? To protect something? Are they on the run? Do they want to be respected? Are they searching for something? Do they have any ideals that they follow? These are all motivations that will give a storyteller a good way to interact with your character. You must have at least one but you should consider having a few so your character isn’t one-dimensional and boring. Be careful of taking too many as well as your character could end up as a conflicted mess.

### **Aesthetic Description**

This is a good place to describe your character's gender, age, weight, build, height, bearing, clothes, stereotypical class, etc. The purpose of this section is to give other players or the storyteller an idea of what your character looks and acts like. If you want anything here to influence your rolls it should also be added to flavor.

This is a good place to describe your character's look. This could include things like gender, age, weight, build, height, bearing, clothes, species (if applicable), stereotypical class, etc. The purpose of this section is to give the other players and the storyteller a mental image of your character. If you want anything here to influence your rolls it should also be added to flavor.

### **Flavor** [[flavor comment]]

Flavor is a word or short phrase describing your character. While you could say your character has clothes and the ability to speak, let’s not worry about that and instead focus on the things that spice your character up! Flavor can include knowledge, possessions, physique, and even social position. Most flavor costs one CP at character creation or one hook for those which are particularly powerful. More flavor can be obtained or inflicted later on in the game.

Flavor is a word or short (two-word) phrase describing your character and it is how you give your character personality and make them unique. While you could say your character has clothes and the ability to speak, let's not worry about that and instead focus on the things that spice your character up! You aren’t just a rebel with a cause, you’re a smokin’ hot rebel with a cause.

Flavor can include knowledge, possessions, physique, and even social position. Flavor costs one [character point](#_o3tr0ykifwm1) (CP) at character creation and can be obtained later in the game at storyteller discretion. The storyteller can inflict flavor upon characters during the story. When resolving a conflict using a check, flavor can sometimes modify the roll making it more or less likely that you succeed. This should not be a piece of flavor’s only purpose.

Third, your character needs [flavor](#flavor). Flavor is a word or short phrase describing a character. It can include knowledge, possessions, physique, and even social position. Review the starting flavor options listed on the setting. This will almost always give your character a language, clothes, and equipment relevant for the setting. When the setting specifies a type of flavor but not what it is specifically you get to choose something that would fit within the setting. Add your choice of starting flavor to your character sheet. Afterward, add flavor to your character to describe them. Flavor costs one character point per after you have your starting flavor. Flavor is usually just that, flavor, but occasionally it can make checks easier or harder.
### **Hooks and Boons**

Character hooks, or hooks for short, are a way to get boons and give the storyteller a way to pull you further into the story. A hook is anything that allows the storyteller to motivate your character specifically. A hook can be a love interest, an enemy, a debt, a cause, a disability, and much more. Boons, on the other hand, are rewards that are unobtainable except through hooks and roleplaying. Both hooks and boons can be anything but usually end up being flavor. The storyteller must agree to grant you the boon you want or either of the boon and major purchase flavors for the hook you are offering; be reasonable. The flavors boon and major purchase are equal in value and can be converted. Speak with your storyteller to trade these flavors for boons or things from the major purchase column of the setting's store.

### **Hooks**

**Hooks** are a special piece of flavor that the storyteller can use to interact specifically with your character to create tension within the story. Adding a hook to your character is the typical way to go about getting a [[Boon]] and it also integrates your character into the story a little better most times. A hook can be a love interest, an enemy, a debt, a cause, a disability, and much more. When you would like to add a hook to your character you must first discuss it with your storyteller and if they agree to let you take the hook you also get a boon. Hooks are distinct from motivations in that they don't always come from within e.g. being #17 on the FBI most wanted list.

### **Boons**

**Boons** are the [[extra powerful version of flavor]]. Boons can only be obtained through [[Hooks]]. Boons allow characters to be abnormally large, a powerful non-human, unusually rich or famous, or have a magic skill, or some smart, loyal minions. Boons can also be exchanged for a renewable [major purchase](#major-purchases).

Boons are the exception to the rules when it comes to flavor and skills. Specifically a boon lets you have a skill or flavor marked as “boon” in the [what is not allowed](#_5nz680a5nyup) section of the setting document. If something there is marked as “boon” your character needs a boon to be or have it. In a world that has none perhaps your character has uncovered the secret to magic or firearms or telecommunication. Boons can only be obtained through hooks and they are usually related. Boons can also be exchanged for a renewable major purchase.
### **Skills**

Skills are the most mechanical part of a character. They allow your character to make actions by rolling checks. Skills have levels and are usually self-descriptively named though there is space for skill descriptions on the character sheet. You can purchase skills with CP at character creation and level them up later using CP.

Skills are listed on the setting. This should include all of the skills the players or storyteller have added to the setting. These skills are available within the setting to any character passing a DTMS check and can be purchased as normal.

lock-picking, pyromancy, lying, and blocking are all examples of skills.
ickpocket, pyromancy, intimidation, stealth, clairvoyance, and blocking are all examples of skills.

Skills are the most mechanical part of a character. They represent the things your character can do within the game and allow your character to take actions by rolling checks. Skills have levels and are usually self-descriptively named though there is space for skill descriptions on the character sheet. You can purchase skills with character points (CP) at character creation and level them up later using CP. Your setting document will have a list of a few example skills you can take that are appropriate for the setting.

Second, your character needs [skills](#skills). Skills are used to roll checks which is how a character interacts with the game world. Skills are usually self-descriptively named and have levels. The higher level the skill the better at it a character is.
There are two kinds of skills. Mandatory skills and the normal kind. 
#### **Mandatory Skills**

Mandatory skills are Body, Mind, Spirit and Social. They are the most broad skills in each of their respective categories which are physical, mental, magical, and... social. These skills can be used to roll any check in their category but scale differently than every other skill. All characters get one level in each mandatory skill for free just in case they have to make a check they don't have an appropriate skill for.

Mandatory skills are skills every character _needs_ within the setting. They are listed at the top of the skills section in the setting. Add all of the mandatory skills to your character sheet. 

#### **Attributes**

Attributes Body, Mind, Spirit and Social. They are similar to skills but have meaningful differences. First, every character gets the first level of each attribute for free. Second, attributes cost significantly more CP to level up than skills do. Third, attributes are broad and if a character does not have an applicable skill they can roll an attribute. For this reason attributes are frequently used as defensive skills and for perception checks. Lastly, attributes represent a character's physical, mental, spiritual, and social health. This is discussed in more depth in the Damage section.

#### **Available Skills**

Available skills are those listed on the setting. This should include all of the skills the players or storyteller have added to the setting. These skills are available within the setting to any character passing a DTMS check and can be purchased as normal.

The rest of the skills are those that are common within the setting and you can take any of them you can afford. Players can also propose to the storyteller that skills be added to the setting. You pay for your starting skills using character points. Starting character points are listed in the upper left of the setting. Both types of skill cost a number of character points equal to the level you want the skill to start at.
```
Example mandatory skills: willpower, strength, magic, dexterity, charisma
Example skills: sword fighting, pyromancy, computer hacking, seduction
```

#### **Recommended Skills**

Even though the mandatory skills should have you covered having some way to attack, defend, sense, communicate, and disagree is a good idea.

For physical skills athletics, acrobatics, endurance, and weapon skills are all fairly useful. For mental skills intelligence, memory, and willpower are all quite useful. Spirit is optional but if your storyteller is allowing magic you should pick a magic school so you can do more interesting magic. For social skills bartering, persuasion, seduction, lying, leadership, and intimidation are all classics.

### **Adding to the Setting**

It is the intent of this system that you can play what you want. Players can speak with the storyteller and propose things to be added to the setting. If you want to play a cat-man samurai talk to the storyteller about adding cat-men to the setting and if samurai need special skills or tools to be relevant, propose those too. If the storyteller agrees, "Boom!", you can play what you want.

It is the intent of this system that you can play what you want. Players can speak with the storyteller and propose things to be added to the setting. If you want to play a cat-man samurai, talk to the storyteller about adding cat-men to the setting and if samurai need special skills or flavor–probably equipment in this instance–to be relevant, propose those too. If the storyteller has no objections, boom, you can play exactly what you want.

#### **Veto**

The storyteller can reject your additions to the setting for any reason. You can bitch and moan but ultimately the storyteller is the one telling the story and doesn't have to put your idea in the story no matter how much you want it there. Come up with a new idea.

@Storyteller: In the interest of reducing arguing, bitching, and moaning, give a reason for your veto.

Many sections in this document talk about “storyteller discretion.” The storyteller can reject your additions to the setting for any reason–though it is best if they give one. You can complain, but ultimately the storyteller is the one telling the story and doesn't have to put your idea in the story no matter how much you want it there.

#### **Theme**

A common reason for an addition to a setting to be rejected is because of theme. Don't try to play a wizard in a non-magic setting. Don't try to play a jedi in a medieval setting. Sure there are storytellers who will jump at that but try to stay within the themes outlined in the setting document.

A common reason for an addition to a setting to be rejected is because of its theme. Most commonly, goofy additions will be rejected when a storyteller wants to tell a “serious” story. Sometimes naming your character Reggie Fuckhammer or being a vampire that shapeshifts into a seagull or platypus will clash a little too much with the setting. Sure there are storytellers who will jump at that but try to stay within the themes outlined in the setting document.

#### **Scope**

Many times, players will try to create skills that are much too broad in scope. Less frequently, players will make skills that are too narrow in scope. Loosely speaking scope represents the percentage of situations a skill can apply to. An example of a skill that is too broad is magic as you can do anything you want with it. A skill that is too narrow would be death curse as it can only be used to kill someone. Somewhere in between we find the skill death magic which has many applications but not infinitely many. It has a specific domain in which it is useful. Storytellers should specifically look out for skills that are too broad during character creation and veto them.

#### **Limiting Factors**

If you create a skill with appropriate scope that is just too powerful for the setting or story (most magic skills) your storyteller may inflict a few limiting factors upon the skill you have proposed or your character.

@Storyteller: A few good limiting factors are timing restrictions(requires multiple turns in combat, cannot be done in combat, takes multiple days, etc.), resource costs (add a mana bar, minor purchases, major purchases, etc.), context restrictions (must have line of sight, must have eye contact, must be touching the target, must have a piece of the target, etc.), and cooldowns (AUTs or turns, once per combat, once per day, refreshes randomly, etc.). If you cannot balance a skill, [veto](#veto) it.

[[problems]] according to ethan, describing round/turn based game actions with the word cooldowns is "unhinged"
#### **Uniqueness**

When you add something to the setting you may have it in your head that it will be unique. You will be the only fire mage, you will have the only gun, you will be the only alien, etc. This can very quickly lead to an unbalanced and unenjoyable setting or story. Do not expect to have a monopoly on anything you add to the setting. Where there is one, there can be two.

### **NPCs**

Tabula treats NPCs the same as every other character. Make a character sheet for them. If they need to be combat capable make sure they have an AD. If they are there to talk make sure they have _at least_ one motivation. Give them CP based on how much you have given the players. It is a good idea to leave a large chunk of an NPCs CP unspent.

If you go through the character creation process for a non-player character (NPC), you should end up with a character of similar power level to the player characters (PCs), assuming you use the same amount of character points (CP). If they need to be combat capable make sure they have an action delay (AD) as outlined in the speed section. If you NPC is there for story purposes make sure they have _at least_ one motivation. Leaving a large chunk of your NPCs CP unspent keeps them flexible so they can grow to meet the needs of your story.

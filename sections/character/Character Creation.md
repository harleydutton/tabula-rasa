1. look at the setting and dream up a character
2. work with the storyteller to make hooks
3. in no particular order spend your CP on flavor, skills, and attribtues. Don't spend more than the setting gives you
	- (optionally create skills referencing the limits on the setting), take skills, and spend CP leveling them up
	- reference the limits on the setting and spend CP on flavor
	- level up attribtues (they all start at 1) using CP
4. get ad from the setting, subtract speed, record your ad

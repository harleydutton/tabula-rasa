2. work with the storyteller to make hooks
3. in no particular order spend your CP on flavor, skills, and attribtues. Don't spend more than the setting gives you

	- reference the limits on the setting and spend CP on flavor
	- level up attribtues (they all start at 1) using CP
4. get ad from the setting, subtract speed, record your ad

To make a character first read through the setting document your storyteller has provided you with. When you have done this and understand the world you will be playing in read through this and fill in the sections for the character sheet--located at the end of this section--using what you have learned. Ask your storyteller for help with things you do not understand or consult the table of contents.

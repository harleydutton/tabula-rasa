- If I decide to keep using [[Boon|Boons]] they should be starred on the character sheet--literally draw a star next to them to mark them.
- I'm not committed to putting a section on the sheet for [[Aesthetic Description]], [[Motivation]], concept, history, or even most of the [[Identification Information]] (character name is the only one that seems strictly necessary).
- tracking number of [[Hooks]] might be interesting. if they are separated out this is done implicitly and I am thinking about removing rewards/incentives for hooks anyway. won't do presently.

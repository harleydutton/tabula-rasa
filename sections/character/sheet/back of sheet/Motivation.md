  - Motivations

Characters must have at least one motivation. Motivations can be Ideals, Values, Causes, or anything else that gets the character out of bed in the morning.

> Alice is motivated by escaping wonderland and finding her way home. Harry is motivated to defeat the dark lord to protect his friends.

Tell me why your character gets out of bed in the morning. What is their purpose? Do they seek revenge? To protect something? Are they on the run? Do they want to be respected? Are they searching for something? Do they have any ideals that they follow? These are all motivations that will give a storyteller a good way to interact with your character. You must have at least one and you should consider taking a few.

You must have at least one but you should consider having a few so your character isnâ€™t one-dimensional and boring. Be careful of taking too many as well as your character could end up as a conflicted mess.

When I was speaking with Ethan about character progression, the concept of terminal motivations came up. Most characters have a reason to begin adventuring, and it might be a good idea to mandate that all characters have a goal which,  once reached, signals the end of their time as an adventurer. This will likely tie into hooks and the storybuilding framework.

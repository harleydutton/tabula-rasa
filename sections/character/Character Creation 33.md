To make a character first read through the setting document your storyteller has provided you with. When you have done this and understand the world you will be playing in read through this and fill in the sections for the character sheet--located at the end of this section--using what you have learned. Ask your storyteller for help with things you do not understand or consult the table of contents.

### **Identification Information**

These things go on your sheet to keep you and your storyteller sane in real life. You can omit these things if you like but it is not recommended and I already carved out some space on the sheet for it.

- Name: The character's name
    
- Player: The player's name
    
- Setting: The name of the character's setting
    
- Story: The name of the story the character was in
    
- Concept:
    

### **Action Delay**

This is how long your character has to wait to do things in combat. Lower means faster. If you would like to decrease your action delay you can do so by spending CP. The typical default action delay is 10 but you should take a look at the setting document provided by your storyteller to make sure.

|   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
       
||**Default**|**-1 AD**|**-2 AD**|**-3 AD**|**-4 AD**|**-5 AD**|**-X AD**|
|Cost for -1 AD|0|1 CP|4 CP|9 CP|16 CP|25 CP|X*X CP|
|Total cost|0|1 CP|5 CP|14 CP|30 CP|55 CP|...|

### **Remaining Character Points**

The storyteller should be tracking the CP they have distributed to the group on the setting document. Each player should be keeping track of how much of this they have not spent on their character sheet such that they can easily take new skills.

### **Motivations**

Tell me why your character gets out of bed in the morning. What is their purpose? Do they seek revenge? To protect something? Are they on the run? Do they want to be respected? Are they searching for something? Do they have any ideals that they follow? These are all motivations that will give a storyteller a good way to interact with your character. You must have at least one and you should consider taking a few.

### **Aesthetic Description**

This is a good place to describe your character's gender, age, weight, build, height, bearing, clothes, stereotypical class, etc. The purpose of this section is to give other players or the storyteller an idea of what your character looks and acts like. If you want anything here to influence your rolls it should also be added to flavor.

### **Flavor**

Flavor is a word or short phrase describing your character. While you could say your character has clothes and the ability to speak, letâ€™s not worry about that and instead focus on the things that spice your character up! Flavor can include knowledge, possessions, physique, and even social position. Most flavor costs one CP at character creation or one hook for those which are particularly powerful. More flavor can be obtained or inflicted later on in the game.

### **Hooks and Boons**

Character hooks, or hooks for short, are a way to get boons and give the storyteller a way to pull you further into the story. A hook is anything that allows the storyteller to motivate your character specifically. A hook can be a love interest, an enemy, a debt, a cause, a disability, and much more. Boons, on the other hand, are rewards that are unobtainable except through hooks and roleplaying. Both hooks and boons can be anything but usually end up being flavor. The storyteller must agree to grant you the boon you want or either of the boon and major purchase flavors for the hook you are offering; be reasonable. The flavors boon and major purchase are equal in value and can be converted. Speak with your storyteller to trade these flavors for boons or things from the major purchase column of the setting's store.

### **Skills**

Skills are the most mechanical part of a character. They allow your character to make actions by rolling checks. Skills have levels and are usually self-descriptively named though there is space for skill descriptions on the character sheet. You can purchase skills with CP at character creation and level them up later using CP.

lock-picking, pyromancy, lying, and blocking are all examples of skills.

#### **Mandatory Skills**

Mandatory skills are Body, Mind, Spirit and Social. They are the most broad skills in each of their respective categories which are physical, mental, magical, and... social. These skills can be used to roll any check in their category but scale differently than every other skill. All characters get one level in each mandatory skill for free just in case they have to make a check they don't have an appropriate skill for.

|   |   |   |   |   |   |   |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
      
|**Level**|**1**|**2**|**3**|**4**|**5**|**X**|
|CP Cost|0 CP|4 CP|9 CP|16 CP|25 CP|X*X CP|
|Total CP|0 CP|4 CP|13 CP|29 CP|54 CP|...|

#### **Available Skills**

Available skills are those listed on the setting. This should include all of the skills the players or storyteller have added to the setting. These skills are available within the setting to any character passing a DTMS check and can be purchased as normal.

|   |   |   |   |   |   |   |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
      
|**Level**|**1**|**2**|**3**|**4**|**5**|**X+1**|
|CP Cost|1 CP|2 CP|3 CP|4 CP|5 CP|X CP|
|Total CP|1 CP|3 CP|6 CP|10 CP|15 CP|...|

#### **Recommended Skills**

Even though the mandatory skills should have you covered having some way to attack, defend, sense, communicate, and disagree is a good idea.

For physical skills athletics, acrobatics, endurance, and weapon skills are all fairly useful. For mental skills intelligence, memory, and willpower are all quite useful. Spirit is optional but if your storyteller is allowing magic you should pick a magic school so you can do more interesting magic. For social skills bartering, persuasion, seduction, lying, leadership, and intimidation are all classics.

### **Adding to the Setting**

It is the intent of this system that you can play what you want. Players can speak with the storyteller and propose things to be added to the setting. If you want to play a cat-man samurai talk to the storyteller about adding cat-men to the setting and if samurai need special skills or tools to be relevant, propose those too. If the storyteller agrees, "Boom!", you can play what you want.

#### **Veto**

The storyteller can reject your additions to the setting for any reason. You can bitch and moan but ultimately the storyteller is the one telling the story and doesn't have to put your idea in the story no matter how much you want it there. Come up with a new idea.

@Storyteller: In the interest of reducing arguing, bitching, and moaning, give a reason for your veto.

#### **Theme**

A common reason for an addition to a setting to be rejected is because of theme. Don't try to play a wizard in a non-magic setting. Don't try to play a jedi in a medieval setting. Sure there are storytellers who will jump at that but try to stay within the themes outlined in the setting document.

#### **Scope**

Many times, players will try to create skills that are much too broad in scope. Less frequently, players will make skills that are too narrow in scope. Loosely speaking scope represents the percentage of situations a skill can apply to. An example of a skill that is too broad is magic as you can do anything you want with it. A skill that is too narrow would be death curse as it can only be used to kill someone. Somewhere in between we find the skill death magic which has many applications but not infinitely many. It has a specific domain in which it is useful. Storytellers should specifically look out for skills that are too broad during character creation and veto them.

#### **Limiting Factors**

If you create a skill with appropriate scope that is just too powerful for the setting or story (most magic skills) your storyteller may inflict a few limiting factors upon the skill you have proposed or your character.

@Storyteller: A few good limiting factors are timing restrictions(requires multiple turns in combat, cannot be done in combat, takes multiple days, etc.), resource costs (add a mana bar, minor purchases, major purchases, etc.), context restrictions (must have line of sight, must have eye contact, must be touching the target, must have a piece of the target, etc.), and cooldowns (AUTs or turns, once per combat, once per day, refreshes randomly, etc.).

#### **Uniqueness**

When you add something to the setting you may have it in your head that it will be unique. You will be the only fire mage, you will have the only gun, you will be the only alien, etc. This can very quickly lead to an unbalanced and unenjoyable setting or story. Do not expect to have a monopoly on anything you add to the setting. Where there is one, there can be two.

### **NPCs**

Tabula treats NPCs the same as every other character. Make a character sheet for them. If they need to be combat capable make sure they have an AD. If they are there to talk make sure they have _at least_ one motivation. Give them CP based on how much you have given the players. It is a good idea to leave a large chunk of an NPCs CP unspent.

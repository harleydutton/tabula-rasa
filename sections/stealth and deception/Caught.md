Also, "Detected"

This is the failure state in the stealth flowchart. This probably doesn't need to be a note, I just want the verbiage to be visible for now.

---

The thief's hidden information has been detected by the guard. No further checks need to be made and the situation can be played out.

> Discovered the thief's lie, saw the thief sneaking up, saw through the thief's disguise, saw the thief's trap, etc.

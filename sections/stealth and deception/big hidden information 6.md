## Hidden Information

Hidden information in roleplaying games can range from lying, to sneaking up on someone, to hiding things. Hidden info is a source of tension and surprise but resolving can be tricky. The way I like to think about it there are two roles when talking about hidden information. One is the thief, the character going around hiding information. The other is the guard, the character trying to discover this information. The information the thief hides can be undiscovered or discovered. The guard can be suspicious or oblivious. Because it will almost certainly come up, it is worth noting that the difficulty of checks related to hidden information should be disclosed by default but doesn't have to be revealed before or even after the check is made. Whenever the thief wishes to hide info or change hidden info they need to make a check.

### Oblivious

Oblivious is a state for the guard and represents that the guard does not know the hidden information and doesn't even know it exists. This is the default state for every character. At any time a player can announce that their character is suspicious and begin being treated that way. NPCs typically need a reason to become suspicious.

When the thief wants to hide info or change hidden info, if there is a guard who could detect them, they need to pass a relevant check. Lying, stealth, disguise, traps, pickpocket, etc. are skills they might use.

Actions to hide information: Lying, moving silently, putting on a disguise, setting a trap, picking a pocket, etc.

### Suspicious

Suspicious represents the state where the guard knows the thief's hidden information exists but doesn't have it. At this point the guard can start making checks to attempt to uncover the hidden info. Pass or fail, when the guard stops looking for the information they should be considered oblivious. The guard might use seeing, hearing, some extra-sensory perception skill, a domain-specific skill like animal handling, or an attribute to try and detect the hidden information.

As a guard on duty, some reasons to become suspicious: Nervous stuttering, heard a noise, clothes don't fit well, saw a wire, felt something in pants, etc.

### Detected

The thief's hidden information has been detected by the guard. No further checks need to be made and the situation can be played out.

Discovered the thief's lie, saw the thief sneaking up, saw through the thief's disguise, saw the thief's trap, etc.

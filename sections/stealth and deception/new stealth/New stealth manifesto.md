Stealth needs to have rewards, punishments, and a system to distribute them.

rewards: stealth is it's own reward; surprise

punishments: getting caught doing shit you shouldn't; cascading failure style extra problems

system: opposed checks with some kind of skip mechanic because opposed checks are slow and annoying.

This is a relevant stealth state for combat stuff. I think the guards would need to be below t3 alert to be surprised. I think I have different degrees of surprise for in combat somewhere around here. maybe in one of the initiative sections.

Attempting to enter stealth from a chase or combat costs an action, a stealth check, and somewhere to hide.

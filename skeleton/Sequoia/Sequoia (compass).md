## Physical Geography
### Where does the story take place?
This doc does not inform on or dictate the story. The story can take place anywhere in the setting. OOS. Bad/useless question.
### What are the topographical features like?
The world is filled with packed dirt.
Pine needles filled with amber large enough to impale a house fall from the sky outside [[Sunspots]].
The rolling stone/metal(hard) roots of the tree form mountain ranges and interesting topography.
There is abundant stagnant water that freeezes outside of sunspots.
[[problems]] I want to talk about the mushroom forests and the darkness and the vampires here but those should go in the flora and fauna sections and the cosmology sections because the are so tightly coupled.
Its hella hot in sunspots and hella cold outside of them.
There are giant glaciers that can form interesting landmasses and push ice/water closer to civilizations.
## Climate and weather
### what is the local climate like?
There is no local climate. That would be story specific.
### does the climate impact the economy
Kinda? The cosmology impacts the econonmy greatly. Light coming from a giant glass fruit in the sky results in a permanent daytime in settlements and permanent night time elsewhere. This lets vampires flourish in the dark. Furthermore the water cycle is broken in this world so the only way people can get water is by venturing out into the dark for ice.
### do the people understand the weather?
No, it is not widespread knowledge that the giant tree is the source of both the darkness and the localized light. It's not even widespread knowledge that there is a giant tree.
### Has climate played a part in evolution?
Well, yes. Every single creature in this world is adapted to this world though most of them are just hand-wavey fantasy critters.
## Flora and Fauna
Lovely, now I need to list my critters and plants with these attributes:
- edible
- intelligent?
- where on the food chain
- habitat
- features?
- can it be used for medicine?
This list is shit. I would also expect the following attribtues out of a bestiary/herbiary
- name
- size
- rarity
- description
- useful for anything? (food, medicine, materials, etc.)
I'm not going to fill all the cirters in tabula out because they live in my head but I will list them and add things I forgot to the previous list:
- frost weavers
- dracobats
- trolls
- ghost moths
- giant yaks
- giant mushrooms
- various (medicinal) fungi/algae

## Races/Species
Seems like a weird distinction between this and flora and fauna. Anyway, questions from the compass framework:
- physiology
- creation story
- reproduction
- lifecycle
- how did they become dominant
- how do they ensure survival
My list of peoples:
- vampires (feral and well-fed)
- kami (kamigawa-esque)
- mushroom people
Missing traits:
- name
- rarity
- intelligence
- fuckitthisisdumbandshouldbethelastsection
## Settlements
In sequoia, settlements pop up wherever three things are in close proximity. Light, mushroom forests, and ice (glaciers?). The compass framework questions are:
- why?
- age?
- size?
- how sophisticated?
- owned by?
## Laws of physics.
gravity? same
thermodynamics? same
electricity? not harnessed
There isn't a sun, there are sun-stones that produce localized heat and light in the same way.
## cosmology
doesn't orbit a star
center 
flat
no
no sun, localized sun stones.
## Arts
is the aarchitecture decorative or utilitarian?
utilitarian
how common is art?
not very. probably present in places of wealth.
whaat kind of music is there?
singing, precussion, "brass", maybe strings, nothing electronic.
what instruments exist...
this is the wrong medium to answer the second to last question.
how do artists survive?
by being extrordinarily wealthy in other regards.
## Magic
hard or soft magic?
eh? pretty soft witha  few rules. the tree sucks in magic. amber is void of magic and pulls it in and breaks. ironwood just saps magic to nothing. ether is magical batteries.
what is your magic based on?
schools:
light magic (healing, light and lightning)
treesinging (reshaping plant matter to suit the user's needs)
fire magic(melt amber, light fires, shoot fire)
what is the source?
rolling dice lol. maybe life essence, idk.
what kind of drawback is there?
none at the time. no limits section. I guess you could say all the amber weapondry and the rare spot of ironwood was pretty antimagic. we never got to mess with that but it was a thing.
how was magic applied?
by casting spells. magic could be made permanent by using a shard of [[Ether]] to anchor a spell.
## history
how were things before now and how did they get here?
what historical events still impact daily life?
how aware are the prople of their history?
I never gave sequoia a history.
A lot of these sections, history in particular seem like they need localized to a settlement.
Fucking hell, this is just too big...
## Society
what do people do for sun/entertainment?
Everyone likes a good execution. I suppose the same shit you would see in mideival movies. Music, circuses, fights, etc.
how has magic or tech affected society?
Magic let society exist. Otherwise humans would be 2nd to last on the food chain. Poorly trained humans still are, they just live in the light.
How does long range communication work?
I think we established that there was a messenger's guild that flew or sent message tubes between sunspots but I don't remember. Otherwise it would be courier. I seem to recall mailmen being pretty badass.
## Social hierarchy
can individuals climb the social ladder?
Unlikely, there is little room for growth in the sunspot. I suppose someone could go out into the dark and find some ether or ironwood but amber and ice won't cut it.
are there slaves/serfs?
not really, no.
how are people of different social statuses treated?
If you you are good at stuff you will get preferential treatment. mages, healers, warriors, farmers and artisans especially.
what is most important to society?
survival. they have their shit together but realistically they are barely hanging on. life is harsh and brutal and short.
## culture
how are different sexes and races treated?
Sexuality is accepted. Nobody gets a pussy pass. This is a meritocracy, earn your keep.
Nobody likes or trusts vampires. There is a vague resentment of the mushroom people because they don't have to fear most of the predators.
How are children, the elderly, sick, and poor people treated.
Kids > adults > everybody else
what differentiates this society from others?
The willingness to throw in with anyone who will help you survive even if it means abandoning people you like/love.
## economy
what is rare and valuable in your world?
ether and ironwood. konwledge. magic. communication.
how does wealth work in your society?
handwavey capitalisim.
how interwinded is the covernment with your evonomy?
this question feels localized, but i suppose pretty darned. making sure everything is getting made was a guild task.
## crafts
how specialized is your society?
very, if you didn't have a skill you  have a crappy life with no upward mobility without great risk.
have any animals been domesticated?
yes, yaks, maybe some other shit.
how are different crafts viewed by your society?
I don't think they have enough to be picky lol.
## traditions/rituals
are there any rites of passage?
First blank accomplishment. Gotta make it there and back to be a mailman. Gotta forge your first lens to be an ambersmith. etc.
how are things celebrated?
feasting, drinking, dancing, etc.
are your rituals and traditions highly religious or cultural?
some of them, sure. Mostly a lot of oral tradition stuff so stuff isn't forgotten.
how long have they existed?
A long god damn time.
## organized failth
who is in charge of the faith?
the head sunbro
what is the chain of command?
IIRC the sunbros were respected for their magic but people thought they were a bit wack.
how do people interact with their dieties?
the kami are around. don't piss them off.
is religion involved in local economy or politics?
yeah, they had clout because of their magic.
## religion
are there multiple religions?
yeah, sure, why not.
is the religion monotheistic or polytheistic? The main one doesn't have a god so much as just a bunch of dudes worshipping the light because it keeps them safe. They haven't personified it. I suppose it would make sense if they had a mythical kami of the sunstone though the actual kami would have hung out near the sunstone.
do gods interact with humanity?
yeah, that's what the kami are about.
how are heretics and heathens treated?
depends on how much of a pain in the ass they are. if they piss off the sunbros enough that the sunbros decide to kill them, there won't be consequenses unless they were important.
## science and tech
how knowledgable is society?
not very. communication is hard. cities are an island.
most knowledge is math and light physics. Maybe some farming and construction too.
does the government control education?
that would be the guilds and yes. that being said it is mostly a matter of having skill or willingness to join up.
is knowledge written down or passed on verbally?
a bit of both probably. important things could be written in amber but it would otherwise be an oral tradition. This probably influences the religious traditions a lot.
## language
does everyone understand each other?
in the same city yes. in other cities, probably not.
how did the usage of language evolve?
in one place. nothing really to stir the pot except mailmen. Mathematics people might have figured out how to do morse code or something.
is there a lingua franca?
maybe the mailmen have one but it isn't widely known.
are there heavy dialects/accents?
not really. just different languages.
## politics
that kind of government is it based on?
meritocracy, capitalism, post apocalyptic movie
how do they restrict and benefit people?
keeps most people fed and alive. pull your weight or maybe starve.
what keeps people in society?
the darkness
## legislature
who is in power?
the guilds
how are new laws created?
the guilds vote make them.
who has what rights?
might makes right broadly. guilds offer protection.
how is power exchanged/succeeded?
usually peacefully. people are sometimes killed.
## judiciary
what happens to people who object to the system?
hard labor or banishment
are there trials and verdicts?
yeah, the guilds probably pass judgment internally and multiple might meet if it concerns multiple.
is there pribery and corruption?
yeah
## executive
who enforces your laws?
guild enforcers
how are they regulated?
minimally. might makes right
how much power do they hold?
as much as a mob enforcer...
how are they organized?
as a gang basically.

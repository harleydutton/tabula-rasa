The purpose of a setting is to introduce the [[World|world]] to the [[Player|players]] such that they can create [[Character|characters]]. To this end some parts are required and some are optional.

## Required
- Basic description of the world
- Default action delay
- Granted character points (this is a running total. You can have it vary by player if you want)
- Default currency (name and description)
- Limits (this is a big section)
- Scope (how much of the world does this setting describe. If it's not the whole thing this document will need updated as the world grows or more of it is revealed) The storyteller can and probably should have a more comprehensive version of the setting than they present the players.
- Content (optional, non-exhaustive list of in-world skills and flavor, your players will likely be adding to this)
- Further descriptions (optional, can be replaced with a worldbuilding framework of your choice. also, you and your players can make this section together.) You can use the real world as a common starting point and make changes or choose to define your world in a vaccume.

[[problems]] I want there to be a place players can go looking for in-setting skills and flavor.
Currently this is the [[Content]] section but I think I might change that to be purely for limited skills and flavor and rename it so it's something along the lines of "additional mechanics" or "mechanical content" because non-mechanical skills and flavor could just be part of one of the many descriptions in the setting. Not sure if this holds up so I'm going to try it.

descriptions will be broadly following the hermetics framework.

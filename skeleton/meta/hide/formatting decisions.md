- Formatting decisions like links and examples that I explicitly want readers to pay attention to will be in a legend (or similar) section in the main document. THIS IS NOT THAT SECTION. This document is for me to help standardize and remember formatting choices I don't need the user to be aware of.
- This document will favor being DRY and having links over being printable because we live in the digital age and I don't want to go through the hassle of getting this printed. It will also be more editable this way. Each section should be a self contained, top level obsidian doc.

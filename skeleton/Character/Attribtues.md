[[balance decisions]] the CP cost to level attributes is exponential. The cp cost is desired level squared. If leveling up an attribute multiple times the level up cost for each intermediary level must be paid.

### Attributes (section taken from skills)

Attributes Body, Mind, Spirit and Social. They are very similar to skills but have meaningful differences. First, every character gets the first level of each attribute for free. Second, attributes cost significantly more CP to level up than skills do. Third, attributes are broad and if a character does not have an applicable skill they can roll an attribute. For this reason attributes are frequently used as defensive skills and for perception checks. Lastly, attributes represent a character's physical, mental, spiritual, and social health. This is discussed in more depth in the Damage section.

    An observation as an extension of that critique: consider a view of D&D that views it not as a system of rules that allows and recommends and guides you in a way, but as a system constructed entirely from negative space. D&D written and interpreted in such a way that it only ever tells you where you _can't_ tread. You can't use that spell with that class. You can't use that spell without a spell slot. You can't have that spell slot with that level. You can't speak that language with that background. It's still... "turing complete", whether the rules are positive or negative. You've constructed an RPG system where the meaningful negotiation about the world (and the characters... and the story...) exists in negative space. And what I hear in the response above is "Don't worry about the RPG system (negative space guidelines), I'll get around to it just as soon as I've finished figuring out the RPG system (description of how my RPG will work)." And that's why I keep saying that I don't (yet) see a system here, just a thought exercise. Because that thing that doesn't exist yet is all the meat AND THE BONES - and what I see now is just a long, elaborate TODO note to figure that out. More distressing to me still, I can't tell if you want Tabula to have RPG rules, or just to have metaguidelines for them. If it's just guidelines, I'm not sure where your unique distinguishing factor is - the thing that enables DM / player content negotiation that couldn't happen in any other system.

    Let me take a more constructive approach. I read this political newsletter, Tangle, and since it's published via email, you can write in as a reader - and I have, a few times, and Issac and I have chatted about a few topics. One of them was conspiracy theories. And one of the core things I said in response to his article was: "An outlandish claim requires a proportionally outlandish burden of proof." That evidence must be proportional to the scope of the conspiracy theory. So, in the pages where you're struggling with how to appropriately scope skills, that seems an effective self-regulation - finding a way to model proportional trade-offs. "I want to learn sailing". Okay, if you want that to be all kinds of sailing forever - knots, celestial navigation, etc - then you lose out on the ability to have free-form skills of another variety in the future. If we want to avoid a skill-slot system for something like this, then we could give guidelines to the Storyteller that they can either expect the trade-off to be offered with the skill proposal (e.g. i get to be an expert sailor because I don't know how to navigate on land and constantly get lost), or constrained to a smaller, more proportional scope later on (e.g. I know how to tie knots as part of my sailing.... but working with my hands put me in a situation where I never learned how to read?). And the guidelines Tabula publishes are on reaching that shared goal of _proportionality_ - as a proposal
